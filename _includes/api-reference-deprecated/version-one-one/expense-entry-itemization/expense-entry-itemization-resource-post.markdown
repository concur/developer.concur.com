#### Itemization elements

|  Element |  Required (must contain value)? |  Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
|  ExpKey |  Y |  The expense type key for the expense. Expense Type Keys are returned in the **ExpKey** element by the Get Expense Group Configuration endpoint. The expense type key cannot be modified when updating expense entries. |
|  Description |  Depends on configuration |  The description for the expense. |
|  TransactionAmount |  Y |  The total amount of the itemization in the original currency, with up to three decimal places. Example: 123.654 |
|  PostedAmount |  Depends on configuration |  The amount of the itemization in the user's reimbursement currency, with up to three decimal places. Example: 123.654. May vary from transaction amount if some of the expense is marked personal or if it has been converted to another currency. See **Notes** for more information. |
|  Custom1 through Custom20 |  Depends on configuration | The Expense Entry Form custom fields. Itemizations are child entries to the expense entry, and they share the custom fields. May be required depending on configuration. Refer to the Processes, **Post Expense Report Data** section of Expense Report for the steps necessary to gather required field information. <br/>**NOTE**: If any of the custom fields are configured to contain list values, please refer to the Posting Custom List Items page for information on how to correctly submit list item values.|

NOTES:

* The update request must include the **ExpKey** and **TransactionAmount** fields. All other fields only need to be included if they were updated.
* Update requests cannot change the **ExpKey** for an existing entry.
* When handling foreign currency transactions, the **CrnCode** and **TransactionAmount** values should indicate the original transaction amount and currency. The **PostedAmount** value should contain the transaction amount converted into the posting currency (the user's reimbursement currency). Concur will calculate the exchange rate for the expense based on these two fields.
