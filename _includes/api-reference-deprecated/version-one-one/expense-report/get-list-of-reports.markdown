### Get List of Reports

```http
GET /api/expense/expensereport/v1.1/ReportsList/{_View_} HTTP/1.1
Host: www.concursolutions.com
```

Retrieves a list of reports. This endpoint can be used to view reports for one user, or to view recent reports for the entire company. If you get reports for one user, you can view reports owned by the user specified in the OAuth access token. If you choose to get all the reports for the company, you must use the LastModified date query string to view reports for a 24 hour period. You can provide an optional View to target search results. If no view or date string is provided, the web service will return all Recent reports for the specified user. If the `LastModified` query string is provided, the results do not filter based on the specified user. This endpoint can support frequent requests, where the developer tracks the previous date/time that the endpoint was called, and uses that as the date/time for the next request.

  | Value | Description |
  | ------ | ------------ |
  | `ApprovalURL` | The URL the user can use to log in to Concur to approve the report. This element appears when requesting the TOAPPROVE status, and does not appear when using the DateModified query. This URL works only when the company does not use Concur SSO with the Enforce option.

**Remarks:**
The `ApprovalURL` provides a link to Expense that can be used with SSO in most circumstances. The link can be put into a browser window, then the approver is automatically logged into Expense **_and_** the expense report opens **_if_**:

The company uses a Concur-supported SSO platform (and does **not** use the Enforce option)  
 - **_and_** -  
The approver is currently on the company network or is using VPN

Otherwise, when the approver clicks the link, the Expense login page appears. The approver logs in and follows the normal steps for approving reports.
