# Attendee Web Service

## Overview

The Attendee Web service allows developers to manage attendees in Concur. The Attendee resource can be used to retrieve attendee information for private or shared attendees. In future releases, the Attendee resource will be updated with additional functionality for managing all attendees in Concur.

The Attendee List resource manages attendees in batches, and can be used to add, update or inactivate attendees. This resource provides functionality similar to the Attendee List Import in Concur. Attendees added using this resource are added to the Shared Attendee List (owned by the system and available to all users).


### Product Restrictions

Concur products are highly configurable, and not all clients will have access to all features.

Partner developers must determine which configurations are required for their solution prior to the review process. Use the [Developer Forum](http://forum.developer.concur.com/){:target="_blank"} if you have questions about the configuration settings.

Existing clients can work with Concur Advantage Technical Services to create customÂ applications that work with their configuration.

### Responses and Errors

Refer to the [HTTP Codes](/tools-support/reference/http-codes.html) page for details of the common responses and errors.


#### Attendee List Errors

The web service will not return a 4xx HTTP response code for a batch operation even when every item in the batch failed to be created or updated. The client must inspect the response to look for warnings or errors with individual batch items.

When there are errors with batch items, the first ten errors are returned in the `<errors>` element in the request response, which includes their error code, the item that caused the error, and the error message. Any additional error messages are truncated. This prevents a large volume of error data in the event of a formatting mistake.
