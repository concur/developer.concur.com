        Register your new application (app) with Concur by filling out this form. Once you have registered an app, you will receive a clientId and clientSecret. The clientId is a unique UUID4 identifier for your app, and the clientSecret is your appâ€™s password. You will be using this credential to obtain tokens either for the app itself, or on behalf of a user.
