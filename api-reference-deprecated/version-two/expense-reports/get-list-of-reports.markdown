# Expense Report Resource: GET List of Reports v2.0

## Versioning Summary
The Get List of Reports version 2.0 endpoint of the Expense Report resource is now DEPRECATED.

It has been superseded by two GET endpoints of a new resource called ReportDigests which can be used to search for expense reports using two or more search criteria and getting an expense report summary. The ReportDigests GET endpoints are:  

* Get all report digests — Returns all report digests the user owns based on the specified search criteria.
* Get a single report digest by ID — Returns a report digest by ID.  

For more information on the ReportDigests resource, see the Expense Report Resource: GET page.

## Description
The Get List of Reports version 2.0 endpoint can be used to get a list of reports for an entire company.

### Get List of Reports Request
**Description**
Retrieves a list of up to 1000 reports to be used in financial and accounting system integration. This endpoint can be used to get a list of reports for the entire company.
Developers that are creating financial system integration may want to use the following search terms to get sets of reports ready for payment from Concur.  

* The BatchID search term specifies the payment batch that the reports are included in. The search term returns all reports included in the specified batch, regardless of time or user. This search term is used with Concur clients who have the Standard Expense and Concurforce products.
* The JobKey search term specifies the accounting extract that the reports are included in. The search term returns all reports included in the specified extract job or batch, regardless of time or user. This search term is used with Concur clients who have the Professional and Premium Expense products.  

Developers can also use one or more of the following search terms to find reports.  

* The HasAttendees search term returns reports that have one or more expense entries with associated attendees.
* The Status search term specifies which report payment or approval status to return. If no Status value is sent, the default Status of Active will be used.
* The PaymentTypeID search term specifies the payment method for the report entries. The report must have at least one entry with the specified payment type. The possible payment types are returned in the PaymentTypeID element by the Get Expense Group Configuration endpoint.
* The ReportCurrency search term returns all reports with the specified reimbursement currency.
* The ReimbursementMethod search term returns reports that are set to be paid by the specified reimbursement method.
* The ReportCountry search term specifies the country indicated on the report.
* The LoginID search term specifies a report owner that is not the OAuth Consumer.
* The ModifiedAfterDate or ModifiedBeforeDate search terms return reports modified after or before a certain date and time.  

**Supported Accept Types**
* application/xml  

**Query Parameters - Optional**  
* BatchID
* HasAttendees
* Job Key
* Status
* ReportCurrency
* PaymentTypeID
* ReimbursementMethod
* Report Country
* LoginID
* ModifiedAfterDate
* ModifiedBeforeDate  

**Batch ID:** The BatchID identifies which payment batch the reports are included in. The BatchID value is returned in the BatchID element in the Response of the Get Payment Batch List endpoint. This search term is used with Concur clients who have the Standard Expense and Concurforce products.  

**HasAttendees:** The HasAttendees query parameter returns reports that have one or more expense entries with attendees. The HasAttendees parameter supports the true value only.  

**Job Key:** The Jobkey identifies which accounting extract or payment batch the reports are included in. The Jobkey value is returned in the id element in the Response of the Post Extract Job Request endpoint, or the jobkey element in the Response of the Post Payment Batch Close endpoint. The View value, if provided, is ignored. This search term is used with Concur clients who have the Professional and Premium Expense products.  

**Status:** The Status value is designed to be used when retrieving reports for the entire company. It can be used only by OAuth consumers with the Web Services Admin role in Concur. If a request is sent by the Web Services Admin that does not contain a Status value, the Active status will be used. The possible status values are:

Value | Description
-----|------
ACTIVE	| Returns unsubmitted and unpaid (payment status is not Paid) reports.
UNSUBMITTED	| Returns unsubmitted reports.
PENDING	| Returns submitted reports pending approval.
ACCOUNTINGREVIEW	| Returns approved reports pending accounting review. These reports are waiting for the Processor to approve the report.
PROCESSING	| Returns processed reports pending financial integration. These reports have an Approval Status of Final Approval and a Payment Status of Unpaid.
INTEGRATED	| Returns reports with financial integration completed. These reports have a Payment Status of Paid.
PENDINGEXTERNALVALIDATION	| Returns reports that are at the Pending External Validation workflow step. This workflow step can be added after report submission and before the report is extracted for payment.
PAYMENTCONFIRMED	| Returns reports with confirmed payments. These reports have a Payment Status of Payment Confirmed.

**Report Currency:** The ReportCurrency identifies the reimbursement currency of the report. This value matches the reimbursement currency of the user who submitted the report. Format: 3-letter ISO 4217 currency code. Example: USD  

**Payment Type ID:** The PaymentTypeID identifies the payment method for entries in the report. At least one entry in the report must have the specified payment type for the report to appear in the list. The possible payment types are returned in the PaymentTypeID element by the Get Expense Group Configuration function. The Payment Type Name of Cash signifies that the employee will be reimbursed directly for the expense.  

**Reimbursement Method:** The ReimbursementMethod identifies the process that the report will be reimbursed with. When using the Reimbursement Method search term, it is recommended to also use the PaymentTypeID search term, where the Payment Type Name = Cash. While it's not required to use Payment Type Name = Cash, doing so delivers results that are relevant for employee reimbursement. The possible ReimbursementMethod values are:

* ADPPAY - ADP Payroll (via EPIP file)
* APCHECK - Company Check (via Accounts Payable)
* CNQRPAY - Expense Pay by Concur
* PMTSERV - Other reimbursement method  

**NOTE:** The ReimbursementMethod search term is not available for Concur Premier- Professional and Premium clients.  

**Report Country:** The Report Country search term returns all reports for the specified country. Format: The 2-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code for report's country. Example: US  

**Login ID:** The LoginID is the Concur login for a report owner that is not the OAuth consumer. This limits the response to reports owned by the specified user.  

**Modified After Date:** This returns reports including their associated dependents (entries, itemizations, allocations, and attendees) that were modified after the specified date and time. This search term can be used along with other search terms to narrow the results. The date and time (if desired) should be in UTC. The format is: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss  

`/api/expense/expensereport/v2.0/Reports/?modifiedafterdate=2012-01-01T00:00:00`

**Modified Before Date:** This returns reports including their associated dependents (entries, itemizations, allocations, and attendees) that were modified before the specified date and time. This search term can be used along with other search terms to narrow the results. The date and time (if desired) should be in UTC. The format is: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss  

`/api/expense/expensereport/v2.0/Reports/?modifiedbeforedate=2012-01-01T00:00:00`

Another example is personal use of a company car. Refer to the Expense: Account Codes Setup Guide for more information on how Concur Expense determines which accounting codes to use.
