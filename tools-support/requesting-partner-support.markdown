Partner cases must include the following:

1. App Name (Partners may have more than one certified app).
2. Customer Name (the name that Concur recognizes)
3. Reproduction steps:
  1. provide contextual information related to the issue so our Engineers have an understanding of what your integration is attempting to do.
4. If applicable:
  1. Employee Name
  2. Expense Report Name, Travel Request Name, Payment Request Name, etc.
  3. Transactional data such as expense type, date, amount, etc.
5. API-related information:
  1. Refresh Token (never supply this via email)
  2. URL being requested
    1. include Method (GET, POST, PUT)
  3.  POST Body (if applicable)
