Partner cases must include the following:

1. App Name (Partners may have more than one certified app).
2. Customer Name (the name that Concur recognizes)
3. Reproduction steps:
  1. provide contextual information related to the issue so our Engineers have an understanding of what your integration is attempting to do.

  2. Expense Report Name, Travel Request Name, Payment Request Name, etc.
  3. Transactional data such as expense type, date, amount, etc.
5. API-related information:
