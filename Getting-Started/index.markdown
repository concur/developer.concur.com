## What is Concur?

Concur is a travel and expense software solution that lets 25M business travelers book their travel, capture expense, submit expense reports, and more.  Concur processes over 55 million transactions every year, representing $50 billion spend on T&E.

## What can I do with Concur APIs?

The **Travel/Itinerary API (v1.1)** lets you access a Concur user's itinerary, including hotel/flight booking info.  As an example, you can mash-up the Itinerary API with a restaurant database/API to provide recommendations of places to eat near a Concur user's hotel booking.

The **Expense API (v3.0)** allows you to get (and push) a Concur user's expense information, including expense line items, their types (e.g. food, lodging), totals, and even receipt images.

Here's an example on how to get an Itinerary List of a Concur user:

```shell
curl https://www.concursolutions.com/api/travel/trip/v1.1
-H "Authorization: OAuth <insert your access token here>"
```

To get an expense summary by using the Expense Report Digest API:

```shell
curl https://www.concursolutions.com/api/v3.0/expense/reportdigests
-H "Authorization: OAuth <insert your access token here>"
-H "Accept: application/json"
```

**To get an access token** (or learn how to generate one), please click [here](#token) to advance to the section below.

You can interact with the API using Swagger [here](https://www.concursolutions.com/api/docs/index.html)

  - [Example apps in the App Center and previous hackathons](#example)

<a name="sandbox">**Create a Concur sandbox**</a>
-----
Before you build your first application that integrates with Concur, you will want to create your own Concur company specifically for development and testing. We call this a developer sandbox, or simply sandbox for short. It is within the sandbox that you will make your application known to Concur.

  1. Start by going to Create Sandbox.
  2. Complete and submit the company information form.
  3. We've provided you with a basic partner application to get you started quickly. The **Welcome** page includes the following information:
 	* The **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** you'll use when making requests to your sandbox. **BE SURE TO SAVE THIS INFORMATION IN A SECURE LOCATION FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.**
  	* The list of **Enabled APIs**
 	* The **Access Token** tied to your user account that you will provide when authenticating with your sandbox for this partner application. **BE SURE TO SAVE THIS INFORMATION IN A SECURE LOCATION FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.**
  4. Click **Get Started.** You will be taken to the Setup Wizard for the sandbox. You can skip most of the setup and fill the fields out later, if desired. You will need to select values for the fields on the **Introduction** page and click **Next**.
  5. You can click **Skip** for the rest of the pages. You may return and configure these pages at any time.
  6. On the **Reporting Configuration** page, click **Done**.
  7. Click **Get Started**. You should now be on the **My Concur** page of your sandbox.

For more detailed information go to [Set Up Developer Sandbox]({{ site.baseurl }}docs/get-started/setup-sandbox/ "Setup Sandbox") .

<a name="token">**Generate an access token**</a>
-----

1.  **Get your Consumer Key**  

    After logging in to http://concursolutions.com, go to Administration -> Register Partner Application -> Concur Partner Application (Modify).  We need the consumer key so we can call the endpoint that would return the access token.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Getting-Started/assets/getting-started3.png" width="600px" />

2.  **Call the access token request endpoint**

    Here's what the HTTP call looks like to request for an access token:

    ```http
    GET https://www.concursolutions.com/net2/oauth2/accesstoken.ashx HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic am9obl9kZXZlbG90bWFpbC5jb206VHJhdmVsJkV4cGVuc2UkMjAxMg==
    X-ConsumerKey: eZByXv2X41cJlC21pSVvRi
    ```

    Note that we already have `X-ConsumerKey` from number 1.  To generate the `Authorization: Basic` value, you need to Base64-encode the login ID, colon and password such that `john_developer@hotmail.com:Travel&Expense$2012` becomes `am9obl9kZXZlbG90bWFpbC5jb206VHJhdmVsJkV4cGVuc2UkMjAxMg==`.  If you're not doing this programmatically yet, you can use this [nifty web tool](http://www.base64encode.org/) to generate that value (remember to choose Encode).

    If you're using a Terminal, an equivalent curl statement of the above would be:

    ```shell
    curl https://www.concursolutions.com/net2/oauth2/accesstoken.ashx
    -H "Authorization: Basic am9obl9kZXZlbG90bWFpbC5jb206VHJhdmVsJkV4cGVuc2UkMjAxMg=="
    -H "X-ConsumerKey: eZByXv2X41cJlC21pSVvRi"
    ```

    If the call is successful, you should get an XML response with a `<Token>` node.  That's your access token. We recommend that you use [Postman](http://www.getpostman.com/), a Chrome extension, to help you manage your API calls (not just Concur ones).  Here's what the API calls look like in Postman:

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Getting-Started/assets/getting-started4.png" width="600px" />

3.  **Call the APIs to pull expense report items**

    After getting an access token, we can pull dummy data from the Expense Report Digest, like so (in Terminal):

    ```shell
    curl https://www.concursolutions.com/api/v3.0/expense/reportdigests
    -H "Authorization: OAuth <insert your access token here>"
    ```

    This would return an Expense Report response, with a field called `ID`.  We need this ID to extract the expense line items we created in the app earlier.  To liven things up a bit, let's use the [Swagger](https://www.concursolutions.com/api/docs/index.html#!/Entries) documentation of the "Entries" API to get the individual expense line items:

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Getting-Started/assets/getting-started5.png" width="600px" />

    We highlighted two things here, the (oval) field where you put in your access token, and the (rectangle) field where you put in the `ID` we got from the previous API call.  Note that we can do this same call in curl, or in any fashion you want.  Swagger just provides us a consolidated way to make the API calls.

    To execute the call, click the "Try it out!" button.  You should get a response like this below:

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started/assets/getting-started6.png" width="600px" />

    **Note: The steps demonstrated above follow the OAuth Native Flow.  If you prefer something similar to a Facebook login experience, you can check out the OAuth Web Flow [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/api-reference/authentication/web-flow.html)**


<a name="dummy">**POST/GET dummy data to/from Concur - the API or app**</a>

      **Hack tip :** More details on the Itinerary API v1.1. [here](https://developer.concur.com/api-documentation/web-services/itinerary/itinerary-resource/itinerary-resource-get)

      POST Expense Report Header to Concur:

      ```http
      POST https://www.concursolutions.com/api/expense/expensereport/v1.1/report HTTP/1.1
      Authorization: OAuth <your access token>
      Content-Type: application/xml

      <Report xmlns="http://www.concursolutions.com/api/expense/expensereport/2011/03">
          <Name>Disrupt Hackathon NYC Trip</Name>
          <Purpose>All Hackathon Expenses</Purpose>
          <Comment>Includes hotel and meals.</Comment>
          <OrgUnit1>US</OrgUnit1>
          <OrgUnit3>Bellevue</OrgUnit3>
          <Custom1>Client</Custom1>
          <Custom2>Local</Custom2>
          <UserDefinedDate>2014-05-01 15:15:07.0</UserDefinedDate>
      </Report>
      ```

      **Hack tip 1:** You can POST using JSON by setting the header to `Content-Type:application/json` and checking out a sample JSON body in our [Swagger](https://www.concursolutions.com/api/docs/index.html#!/Entries) doc.  Note that the examples here use v1.1, and those shown in Swagger use v3.0.

      **Hack tip 2**: You need to generate a report header to be able to submit an expense entry.  A collection of entries is a report.

      *Click [here](https://developer.concur.com/api-documentation/web-services/expense-report) to view the relationship of an Expense Report Header to an Expense Report Entry and search for **Expense Report Processes**.*

      GET Expense Report Details:

      ```http
      GET https://www.concursolutions.com/api/expense/expensereport/v2.0/Reports/?reportcountry=US HTTP/1.1
      Authorization: OAuth <your access token>
      Content-Type: Application/json
      ```

      POSTing Expense Report Entry:

      ```http
      POST https://www.concursolutions.com/api/expense/expensereport/v1.1/report/B6F4FD62FB424911A3B8/entry HTTP/1.1
      Authorization: OAuth <your access token>
      Content-Type: application/xml

      <ReportEntries xmlns="http://www.concursolutions.com/api/expense/expensereport/2011/03">
          <Expense>
              <CrnCode>USD</CrnCode>
              <ExpKey>BRKFT</ExpKey>
              <Description>Starbucks for Breakfast</Description>
              <TransactionDate>2014-05-01</TransactionDate>
              <TransactionAmount>15.54</TransactionAmount>
              <Comment>Breakfast meeting</Comment>
              <VendorDescription>Starbucks</VendorDescription>
              <IsPersonal>N</IsPersonal>
          </Expense>
      </ReportEntries>
      ```

  2.  **Pushing dummy expense data to Concur using the app**

      You can access the web version of Concur at http://concursolutions.com/ or get the mobile app from [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/concur-travel-receipts-expense/id335023774?mt=8) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.concur.breeze).

      <center>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Getting-Started/assets/getting-started1.png"/>
      </center>

      You can view/add new expenses (and even add a receipt image!) to have a variety of data to pull for your API calls. After adding expenses, you can create a report to associate it with by tapping the "Add to Report" button (in the last screenshot above).


<a name="example">Example apps</a>
-----
All app integrations with Concur can be found in the [App Center](https://www.concur.com/en-us/app-center).  Below are just two examples that would hopefully give you an idea on what to build:

- [Challengepost](http://challengepost.com/software/built-with/concur) lists Concur API integrations from previous hackathons.  Definitely worth checking out!

 - [TravelText](https://www.concur.com/en-us/partners/transaction-capture/traveltext) - TravelText allows you to text your expenses right into Concur. No more paper receipts and Excel sheet mayhem!  Check out their video demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxY_PO-QKZ0).

 - [Trover](https://www.concur.com/en-us/app-center/listing/nDhf34TiiC9RCocFM2xViin5c/Trover) - it's travel photography + business travel integration in one great app. Quoting from this [article](http://skift.com/2013/07/25/travel-photography-app-trover-secures-2-5-million-in-funding-from-concur/#/0), what they get for integrating with Concur is *"being able to tap into Concur’s experience, knowledge and “great visibility into travel patterns"*.
