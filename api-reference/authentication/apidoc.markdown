## <a name="access_token"></a>Access Tokens


The Oauth2 service generates access tokens for authenticated users, applications or companies. The tokens are created using the JSON Web Token (JWT) format.
The token returned in the Oauth2 response can be used to access protected resources on Concur's services.

The Oauth2 response can, depending on grant type contain these values

Name | Type | Format | Description
-----|------|--------|------------
`expires_in`|`string`|-|The lifetime in seconds of the access token
`scope`|`string`|-|The scope of the access token as granted to the client application
`token_type`|`string`|-| The type of token returned. Value will be `Bearer`
`access_token`|`string`|-|JSON Web Token (JWT) used to access pprotected resources of Concur's services.
`refresh_token`|`string`|-|Refresh token required to request a new access token for a given user.
`geolocation`|`string`|-|The base URL for where the user profile lives 

**Token Response**

	"token_type": "Bearer",
	"access_token": "access_token",
	"refresh_token": "refresh_token",
  "geolocation": "https://us.api.concursolutions.com"
}
```

The structure of the access_token is as follows (as an example):

```
Header:
{
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "RS256",
  "kid": "1455614346"
}
Payload:
{
  "concur.version": 2,
  "aud": "*",
  "sub": "08BDDA1E-0D4F-4261-9F1B-F9B8D9F817D6",
  "iss": "https://[us|emea].api.concursolutions.com",
  "exp": 1465194622,
  "nbf": 1465191022,
  "concur.type": "[user|company|app]",
  "concur.app": "https://[us|emea].api.concursolutions.com/profile/v1/apps/08BDDA1E-0D4F-4261-9F1B-F9B8D9F817D6",

  "concur.scopes": [
    "resource.sub-resource.action"
  ],
  "iat": 1465191022
}
```

* `concur.version` - is the version of the JWT schema in use. 
* `concur.type` - is the type of principal this JWT refers to. eg. user, company or application.
* `concur.app` - a link to the app that created this token. 
* `concur.profile` - is a link to the user's profile.
* `concur.scopes` - the scopes that the principal permitted the app to use on its behalf
* `sub` - is a UUID4 identifier for the subject of the JWT.
* `iss` - this is the datacenter/region that issued this token
* `exp` - the unix timestamp at which the token will expire
* `nbf` - the unix timestamp before which the token should not be used (not terribly interesting to us)
* `iat` - the unix timestamp at which this token was issued


## <a name="obtain_token"></a>Obtaining a token

You can obtain a token for three different types of principals in the Concur universe. 

* User
* Application
* Company

**Token Lifetime**

An `accessToken` has a one hour lifetime.

In order to obtain a token, the client application needs to call the Oauth2 endpoint using various `grants` depending on the authentication scenarios required. The full list of supported scenarios is provided below:

  * [Authorization grant](#auth_grant)
  * [Password grant](#password_grant)
  * [Client Credentials grant](#client_credentials)
  * [One time password grant](#otp_grant)

## <a name="refresh_token"></a>Refreshing a token


The refresh grant is used to refresh an access_token that has expired. This grant can be used anytime a refresh_token is returned in the response of another grant request. No user interaction is required.

**Token Lifetime**

A refresh token has a **six month** lifetime. if the refresh token expires, the client application must reinitiate the authorization process. When a refresh token is used to request a new access token, both a new access token as well as a new refresh token are returned in the response.

It is recommended that the client application use the refresh grant to request a new access token as the initial step of accessing protected resources of Concur's services.

**Refreshing the token**

To request a new access token using a valid refresh token, use the Oauth2 /token endpoint. Use the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type and character encoding `charset=utf-8` to specify the parameters listed below in the request body.

`POST /oauth2/v0/token`

**Parameters**

Name | Type | Format | Description
-----|------| ------ | -----------
`client_id`|`string` | `UUID` | **Required** The client applications client_id supplied by App Management
`client_secret`|`string` | `UUID` | **Required** The client applications client_secret supplied by App Management
`refresh_token`|`string` | `UUID` | **Required** An existing valid refresh token to be used to request a new access token
`scope`|`string` | | The client applications list of scopes
`grant_type`|`string` | | **Required** The grant type instructs the Oauth2 service how to process the request. For refresh token, the value must be `refresh_token`

**Request**

  "refresh_token": "new-refresh_token",
  "geolocation": "https://us.api.concursolutions.com"
}

```

## <a name="revoke_token"></a>Revoking a token

All refresh_tokens associated to a user for an application can be revoked by calling the `/app-mgmt/v0/apps` endpoint. You have to provide the User's `accessToken` in the Authorization Header as `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`

`DELETE /app-mgmt/v0/apps/{appId}/principals/me/refreshToken`

**URL Parameters**

Name | Type | Format | Description
-----|------| ------ | -----------
`appId`|`string` | `UUID` | **Required** The client applications client_id supplied by App Management


**Request**

```
http

DELETE /app-mgmt/v0/apps/{appId}/principals/me/refreshTokens HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>

```

**Response**

## <a name="manage_token"></a>Managing tokens

Refresh Tokens are UUID4 identifiers that allow your application to obtain a fresh `accessToken` on behalf of a user to access Concur's APIs. 

```
e013335d-b4ce-4c43-a7e4-b67abc1adcb0
```

It is highly recommended that you store Refresh Tokens together with your user's authorization metadata in your application every time you obtain a new `refreshToken` as they might change depending on different scenarios.

## <a name="base_uri"></a>Base URIs

Environment | URI 
-----|------
US Production |`https://us.api.concursolutions.com/oauth2/v0`
EU Production |`https://emea.api.concursolutions.com/oauth2/v0`

## <a name="id_token"></a>ID Token

If your application was registered with the 'openid' scope, the Authentication service will return an [OPENID](http://openid.net) compatible [ID token](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken).

```
Sample id_token:

{
  "aud": "e010e25d-b4ce-4ce3-a7e4-b670cb1adcb0",
  "concur.profile": "https://us.api.concursolutions.com/profile/v1/pricipals/76459ad3-f77b-4d98-a21a-55333c9179f0",
  "concur.version": 2,
  "concur.type": "user",
  "sub": "76459ad3-f77b-4d98-a21a-55333c9179f0",
  "iss": "https://us.api.concursolutions.com",
  "exp": 1476215558,
  "userURI": "https://us.api.concursolutions.com/profile/v1/users/76459ad3-f77b-4d98-a21a-55333c9179f0",
  "useruuid": "76459ad3-f77b-4d98-a21a-55333c9179f0",

  "iat": 1476211958
}
```

### Verifying an id_token
The Authentication service exposes [JWKs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517) that can be used to validate the id_token in the form of a JWT. Validating a JWT is described in detail in [RFC 7519 - sec 7.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-7.2)

## <a name="auth_grant"></a>Authorization grant

The authorization grant is the regular 3-legged oauth2 grant and is defined in detail in [RFC6749 sec-4.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1). This grant requires the user to explicitly authenticate themselves and authorise the application initiating the grant. 

The users *must be* able to authenticate themselves via a Concur username & password. Users will be challenged to login by an Oauth2 HTML page.

**Who should use it**
* 3rd party "partner" websites - or - 
* non-Concur Applications - & - 
* Applications that need explicit user authentication & authorization - & -
* Applications that can securely store a code, access_token & refresh_token

## <a name="otp_grant"></a>One Time Password grant


The One-time Password grant type leverages email, phone (text messaging), instant messaging and similar systems to provide per user access tokens to client applications. This grant type requires the following steps:

1. The calling application calls the OAuth2 service specifying the otp grant type along with required parameters.
2. The OAuth2 service generates a one time token which it sends through the messaging mechanism chosen by the application.
3. The user retrieves the token and presents it to the application. The means of having this presented to the application is the responsibility of the application.
4. The application presents this one-time token to the OAuth2 service via the token endpoint.


**Request a one-time token to be sent to the user**

Use the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type and character encoding `charset=utf-8` to specify the parameters listed below in the request body.

`POST /oauth2/v0/otp`

**Parameters**

Name | Type | Format | Description
-----|------|--------|------------
`client_id`|`string`|`UUID`|**Required** The client_id as defined in the Concur application management system.
`client_secret`|`string`|`UUID`|**Required** The client_secret as set by the client owner in the Concur application management system.
`channel_handle`|`string`|-|**Required** The location (email address, phone number) where the one time token should be sent. Currently, only `email address` is valid.
`channel_type`|`string`|-|**Required** The type of messaging system to use. Currently only `email` is valid
`name`|`string`|-|*Optional* The name of the user that appears in the email.
`company`|`string`|-|*Optional* The company or application name that appears in the email. 
`link`|`string`|-|*Optional* The callback URL that appears in the email for users to click to complete the auth flow.


The calling application code can also append n-number of unique client defined parameters in the URI for the purpose of connecting the one time token to the application when received by the user. The names of these parameters cannot conflict with the API defined parameters.

The following are reserved words and cannot be used as client application defined parameters:

```
/otp: "client_id" "client_secret" "channel_type" "channel_handle"
```

```
/token: "client_id" "client_secret" "channel_type" "channel_handle" "scope" "grant_type" "otp"
```

If the calling application chooses to send custom parameters, all of these exact same parameters *must be* included in subsequent API calls to acquire the access token. In other words, the URI signature, modulo the one time token parameter itself and token service specific parameters, *must match* the originating URI signature.
