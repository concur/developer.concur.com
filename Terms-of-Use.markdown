6.     INDEMNIFICATION

6.1   By Concur.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Concur shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Licensee and its employees, agents, successors and assigns from and against any and all loss, damage, liability, and expense arising from any claim brought against any such indemnified party by a third party to the extent (a) alleging that the API Services, as provided by Concur and used in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, infringes upon any valid U.S. patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other proprietary right of such third party, or (b) resulting from Concur’s breach of its warranty in Section 5.1(a).  Notwithstanding the above, Concur shall have no liability for any infringement claim which:  (i) pertains to any Concur Software Development Kit that has been altered or modified without Concur’s prior written approval; or (ii) is based on use of the API Services in conjunction with any item not provided by Concur, unless such use is shown to constitute the infringement when not used in conjunction with the item not provided by Concur.

6.2   By Licensee.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Licensee shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Concur and its employees, agents, successors and assigns from and against any and all loss, damage, liability, and expense arising from any claim brought against any such indemnified party by any third party to the extent (a) alleging that the Licensee Data, or Licensee’s use of the API Services in violation of the terms of this Agreement, infringes upon any valid patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other proprietary right of, or otherwise harms, such third party; (b) resulting from the failure of Licensee to comply with its obligations under this Agreement or from the acts or omissions of Licensee or its employees, agents, successors or assigns; or (c) resulting from Licensee’s breach of its warranty in Section 5.1(a).

6.3   Defense; Procedure.  For any indemnifiable claim described in this Section 6:  (a) the indemnifying party shall have the sole responsibility, at its expense, to defend and, at its sole discretion, to settle any such claim, provided that, if any settlement requires a non-monetary obligation of an indemnified party (other than ceasing use of the API Services), then such settlement shall require the indemnified party’s prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld; and (b) each indemnified party shall provide the indemnifying party with prompt written notice of any such claim brought against it, together with copies of all related court documents involving such claim.  An indemnified party’s failure to provide prompt notice to the indemnifying party of any such claim shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability under this Section 6 with respect to such claim, unless the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such failure, in which case the indemnifying party shall have no obligation under this Section 6 with respect to such claim.  If any compromise or settlement is made with respect to such claim, the indemnifying party shall pay all amounts in settlement of such claim.  The indemnified party shall provide the indemnifying party with such information and assistance for the defense of such claim as the indemnifying party reasonably requests.

7.     CONFIDENTIALITY

7.1   Confidential Information.  In connection with this Agreement, Concur may disclose its confidential or proprietary information to Licensee.  Subject to the exceptions listed below, “Confidential Information” shall be defined as information disclosed by Concur to Licensee under this Agreement that is either:  (a) clearly marked or otherwise clearly designated as confidential or proprietary; or (b) should be reasonably understood by Licensee to be the confidential or proprietary information of Concur.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Concur Software Development Kit, any Submissions, and all pricing under this Agreement are the Confidential Information of Concur.

7.2   Confidential Treatment.  During and after the term of this Agreement, Licensee shall not use, or otherwise disclose to any third party, any Confidential Information without the prior written consent of Concur.  In addition, Licensee shall take reasonable measures to protect the Confidential Information and to ensure that such Confidential Information is not disclosed, distributed, or used in violation of the provisions of this Agreement (which measures shall be no less than that which a reasonable person would take with respect to like confidential, proprietary, or trade secret information).

7.3   Exceptions.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the obligations of Licensee set forth in this Section 7 shall not apply to any information of Concur that:  (a) is or becomes a part of the public domain through no wrongdoing of Licensee or any third party; (b) was in Licensee’s possession free of any obligation of confidentiality at the time of Concur’s communication thereof to Licensee; (c) is developed by Licensee completely independent from the Confidential Information; or (d) is required by law or regulation to be disclosed, but only to the extent and for the purpose of such required disclosure after providing Concur with advance written notice, if reasonably possible, such that the Concur is afforded an opportunity to contest the disclosure or seek an appropriate protective order.

7.4   Remedies.  Licensee recognizes and agrees that money damages are an inadequate remedy for breach of this Section 7 and further recognizes that any such breach would result in irreparable harm to Concur.  Therefore, in the event of any such breach, Concur may seek injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin such activity in addition to any other remedies available to it.

8.     TERM AND TERMINATION

8.1   Term.  The term of this Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and will continue so long as Licensee continues to use the API Services, unless terminated earlier in accordance with this Agreement.

8.3   Termination for Cause.  In the event of a material breach of this Agreement by either party, the non-breaching party may give written notice of such breach to the breaching party and, if the same is not cured within thirty (30) days after delivery of such notice, then, without limitation of any other remedy available hereunder, the non-breaching party may terminate this Agreement by delivery of a written notice of termination at any time thereafter to the breaching party.  Such termination shall be effective as of the date of the notice of termination or such later date as set forth in such notice.

8.4   Duties Upon Termination; Return of Confidential Information; Survival.  Upon termination of this Agreement:  (a) all rights granted to Licensee under this Agreement shall immediately terminate, in which case Concur may invalidate Licensee’s API Keys and otherwise deny further access to the API Services; and (b) within thirty (30) days after such termination, Licensee will return to Concur or destroy all Concur Software Development Kit and Confidential Information that is in its possession or control.  Termination of this Agreement shall not be construed to waive or release any claim that a party is entitled to assert at the time of such termination (including any claim for fees accrued or payable to Concur prior to the effective date of termination), and the applicable provisions of this Agreement shall continue to apply to such claim until it is resolved.  Sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7.3, and 8 of this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason.
