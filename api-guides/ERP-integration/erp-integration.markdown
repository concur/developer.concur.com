## ERP Integration

This API Recipe describes API tasks associated with ERP Financial Integration. This App is intended for financial integration companies or finance leaders who want to streamline the processes once Expense Reports in Concur have been final-approved and are ready to be integrated into the client's financial system.

Before a partner can obtain expense report data from Concur, ensure that you have completed the following:

- Ensure your app has been certified by Concur
- Ensure your organization has obtained a signed letter of Agreement from a client stating that you can obtain that client’s expense report data using the extract file created by Concur’s service
- Ensure your app can authenticate with Concur. See authentication docs [here](/api-reference/authentication/apidoc.html).
- Ensure your app includes the ability to [refresh the Concur authentication token](/api-reference/authentication/apidoc.html#refresh_token)
- Ensure your app includes the ability to respond appropriately to [revoked token messages](/api-reference/authentication/apidoc.html#revoke_token)

#### Professional Edition ERP Integration
Professional Edition ERP Integration assumes that you are working for or on behalf of a Financial Integration Company. The client we support in common may have elected to include additional functionality that could result in complex journal entries. For example, your client may allow cash advances or utilize a company-paid corporate card program where personal amounts result in an employee owing the employer. These configuration choices require more care when pulling the extract file from Concur. Contact Concur to request the CTE Extract Example Cases document. Then, consult with the client to determine if their configuration will result in any of the Sample Cases described in the document.  contact = pdspe@concur.com


#### Standard Edition vs. Professional Edition
Consult with your client so they can inform you if they are using Standard or Professional Edition of the Concur Service.  Both editions produce extract files that you will use as part of the integration, however, there are distinct differences between them in obtaining the extract files.  If the client is unsure of the Edition-type, Standard Edition will have a "Setup" menu option within the Administration menu as displayed to an administrative user.  Professional Edition will not have a "Setup" menu within the Administration menu.

##### Get Extract Files for your client

Use the following process and their associated API to obtain extract files for your client from Concur:

Navigate to [Extracts](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/common/extracts/extracts.html).

Professional Edition:

1.  Obtain a list extract definitions for your client. Keep in mind that the authorization header with the OAuth token must be for a valid user. The OAuth consumer must have one the following role in Concur: Web services Administrator for Professional ERP Integration.

    Your GET request looks like the example:

        xml
        GET https://www.concursolutions.com/api/expense/extract/v1.0/ HTTP/1.1
        Authorization: OAuth {access token}

    XML example of a successful response:

        xml
        200 OK
        Content-Type: application/xml
        <definitions xmlns="http://www.concursolutions.com/api/expense/extract/2010/02">
            <definition>
                <id>https://www.concursolutions.com/api/expense/extract/v1.0/nYoPK$pZmcowMRUqcl5bnDAwwsMydyt$xd</id>
                <job-link>https://www.concursolutions.com/api/expense/extract/v1.0/nYoPK$pZmcowMRUqcl5bnDAwwsMydyt$xd/job</job-link>
                <name>Standard Accounting Extract</name>
            </definition>
            <definition>
                <id>https://www.concursolutions.com/api/expense/extract/v1.0/Umj$swS19lpd7Sk$phUYl67wE1ss4Q$shu</id>
                <job-link>https://www.concursolutions.com/api/expense/extract/v1.0/Umj$swS19lpd7Sk$phUYl67wE1ss4Q$shu</job-link>
                <name>European Extract</name>
            </definition>
            <definition>
                <id>https://www.concursolutions.com/api/expense/extract/v1.0/8LjhN23Hs33$piUUfy4ytTqa$sqqacYeP1</id>
                <job-link>https://www.concursolutions.com/api/expense/extract/v1.0/8LjhN23Hs33$piUUfy4ytTqa$sqqacYeP1</job-link>
                <name>Asian Extract</name>
            </definition>
        </definitions>

2. Locate the desired definitions for your client. You may need to obtain additional details as there may be multiple files to obtain depending on client requirements. You should record the Definition ID to use in subsequent APIs because doing so eliminates a common step. Your GET extract definitions details request looks like the example

        xml
        GET https://www.concursolutions.com/api/expense/extract/v1.0/{DefinitionID} HTTP/1.1
        Authorization: OAuth {access token}

    XML example of a successful response:

        xml
        200 OK
        Content-Type: application/xml
        <definition xmlns="http://www.concursolutions.com/api/expense/extract/2010/02" xmlns:i="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
            <id>https://www.concursolutions.com/api/expense/extract/v1.0/n59FpBJ8hN3qVWTFIrtxkOT5$pef6DmIj3</id>
            <name>AMEX Remittance - US</name>
            <job-link>https://www.concursolutions.com/api/expense/extract/v1.0/n59FpBJ8hN3qVWTFIrtxkOT5$pef6DmIj3/job</job-link>
        </definition>

3. Obtain and record the Job_ID using this GET request: https://www.concursolutions.com/api/expense/extract/v1.0/{DefinitionID}/job.
This will request a list of the last 100 extract jobs run for the specified extract definition.

    XML example of a Job ID GET request:

        GET https://www.concursolutions.com/api/expense/extract/v1.0/nYoPK$pZmcowMRUqcl5bnDAwwsMydyt$xd/job HTTP/1.1

        ...
    XML example of a successful response:

        200 OK
        Content-Type: application/xml

#### Standard Edition ERP Integration

Standard Edition ERP Integration assumes that you are working for or on behalf of a Financial Integration Company. Once your app is certified, and you have obtained a signed letter of agreement from a client, you can obtain that client’s expense report data through the extract file produced by Concur’s service.

#### API’s used to obtain extract files for your client
Before you begin, you need to close the Payment Manager batch using the appropriate API’s in order for you to retrieve the files using the API below. Ask your client not to close the batch manually through the User Interface.

  Navigate to [Payment Batches](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/expense/payment-batch/payment-batches.html).

  1. **Obtain a list of your client’s batches** by using [Get list of batches]( https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/expense/payment-batch/payment-batches.html#getpaymentbatches)
    Example

          GET /expense/paymentbatch/v1.1/batch/_{BatchID}_/file

  2. **Close the desired batch** by using [Close a payment batch]( https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/expense/payment-batch/payment-batches.html#closepaymentbatch)
    Example


          POST /expense/paymentbatch/v1.2/batch/{BatchID}/close

  3. **Retrieve the file you want** by using [Retrieve a payment batch file](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/expense/payment-batch/payment-batches.html#getbatchfile)
    Example

          GET /expense/paymentbatch/v1.1/batch/_{BatchID}_/file
