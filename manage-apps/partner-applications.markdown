##  Registering a Partner Application

The first action all developers need to take is to register a partner application with Concur. Before you can obtain a JSON Web Token (JWT), you need to register an application with Concur. You can do this by contacting your Partner Enablement Manager or Partner Account Manager. Once you have registered an application, you will receive a clientId and clientSecret. The clientId is a unique UUID4 identifier for your application, and the clientSecret is your applicationâ€™s password. You will be using this credential to obtain tokens either for the application itself, or on behalf of a user. For more information on this process, please refer to our [Getting Started guide for authentication](/api-reference/authentication/getting-started.html)
