  <h2>Setting up a sandbox</h2>
  
  <p>
    Sandboxes are required for partners or customers looking to use Concur's APIs to read and write data from Concur.  It is important that 
    you contact your assigned technical resource at Concur to gain access to a sandbox that best fits your scenario.
  </p>
   <p>    
     If you are unsure of your technical contact, consider these 3 scenarios then identify the correct contact via the page below:
     <ol>
       <li>Develop an application for the Concur App Center.  This requires a signed Partner Agreement.
       <li>Develop an application as a Concur client (or for a client).  The client must purchase the Web Services SKU.
       <li>Develop an application as a TMC/reseller.
     </ol>
