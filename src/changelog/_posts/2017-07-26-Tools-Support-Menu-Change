#### Tools/Support tab updated

<p>
We changed the [Tools&Support](/tools-support/support.html) section of developer.concur.com to emphasize where and how to get support from Concur.  Support is now the top
menu option, and there are new details around how to get support depending upon what type of Partner of Client you are.
