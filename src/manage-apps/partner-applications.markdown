##  Registering a Partner Application

After a business has passed the Business Development vetting process for an App Center partnership, the Partner Certification team will be engaged to establish a sandbox and register an app for the Partner sandbox.  These steps must take place before a Partner can obtain a JSON Web Token (JWT).

Once the DEVELOPMENT application has been registered, you will receive a clientId, clientSecret, and a deep link to a test App Center listing. The clientId is a unique UUID4 identifier for your application and the clientSecret is your applicationâ€™s password. You will be using this credential to obtain tokens for either the application itself or on behalf of a user. For more information on this process, please refer to our [Getting Started guide for authentication](/api-reference/authentication/getting-started.html).
