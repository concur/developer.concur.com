## Welcome!

SAP Concur is pleased to welcome you as a partner. We encourage all SAP Concur App Center partners to create comprehensive marketing plans that incorporate PR, social media, digital marketing, events, and sales training to help make your integrated solution successful. The App Center Marketing team is here to support and extend your efforts by largely focusing on two audiences – 1) our customers and prospects, and 2) our field organization that interfaces with prospects and maintains our relationships with customers.​

Through our App Center marketplace, our events, and direct marketing campaigns, we communicate the value of your solutions directly to customers. Through our internal-facing resources and programs, we enable our field organization to understand and speak effectively about our partner solutions. ​

The toolkit and best practices found here will help us maximize your opportunity with both. We look forward to working with you!

### <a name="messaging-framework"></a>Messaging Framework
This messaging framework can be used to create compelling marketing content and collateral.​

* **Target Audience**<br>Who is the intended audience? App Center partner content is distributed to two main audiences: customers/prospects and the SAP Concur field who help introduce them to your solution. If the content is intended for a customer, which roles or departments is this relevant for?  
* **Features & Benefits**<br>What are your key features and benefits? How does your integration work? What are some testimonials/stories from existing customers?  
* **Challenges or Goals**<br>What problems can your integrated solution help them solve?  
* **Unique Capabilities**<br>How is it different from alternative or existing solutions? (Note: avoid superlative language like “the leading” or “the best” unless it is corroborated by statistics.  
* **Value Proposition**<br>How will your integration with SAP Concur solutions deliver value to the customer?  
* **Call to Action**<br>What action should the audience take? Ex. follow up for more information? Connect through the App Center?

### <a name="content-best-practices"></a>Content Best Practices

## <a name="public-relations-and-social-media-guidelines"></a>Public Relations and Social Media Guidelines

* [Press Release](#press-release)
* [Social Media Overview](#social-media-overview)

### <a name="press-release"></a>Press Release

SAP expects to review and approve all partner press releases that reference SAP or an SAP subsidiary, including SAP Concur, its solutions, products, services, and/or partnerships with SAP before a partner distributes publicly.

*	The following guidelines are designed to make the approval process easier:
*	Press releases are limited to new partners or partners with an application update. Your application must be live in the App Center prior to issuing a press release. 
*	Press releases must be issued by the partner, not by SAP Concur. Please refrain from using language such as “Partner and SAP Concur announce…”
*	Use the provided templates to help streamline review timelines and approvals.
	*	For non-English language press releases, please email concur_AppCenterMarketing@sap.com. 
*	Please refrain from overstating the nature of the relationship or making claims about future details or expansions of the partnership that are not yet public.
*	Refer to your partner status as an “SAP Concur partner,” and not a “Concur partner.”
*	No SAP Concur quote, logo, or boilerplate should be included in partner-issued press releases or blogs.
	*	Note: On rare exception SAP Concur may permit an SAP Concur quote in a partner-issued press release or blog. Including a quote on an exceptional basis is at the sole determination and discretion of the SAP Partner PR Team. Additional approvals and time are required in the event an SAP Concur quote is approved for use.

Please send your release to [concur_AppCenterMarketing@sap.com](mailto:concur_AppCenterMarketing@sap.com) for review prior to submission to the SAP PR Team.

[**Download the Press Release Template**](https://partnerportal.concur.com/ResourceFiles/b517bc83-f0e0-4aab-b61d-af313f6d22b7.pdf)


### <a name="social-media-overview"></a>Social Media Overview

In addition to issuing a press release highlighting your SAP Concur integration, we encourage you to promote it through social media channels. Please share all blog posts, Tweets and Facebook posts with App Center Marketing for approval. We will work with you to jointly promote your posts and better amplify the message.

> Please ensure blog posts, tweets and Facebook posts go out after any press releases are issued.

#### <a name="social-media-overview-blog-posts"></a>Blog Posts

Blog posts are a great way to create keyword-heavy content that helps optimize your site for search engines in order to help people find you online and feature your integration with SAP Concur. We encourage these blog posts to include as many visuals, including screenshots of the application integration points, if possible. Links back to the SAP Concur website are also highly encouraged. Create content that clearly and accurately describes the integration and be thoughtful about which keywords are linked back to your App Center listing. For example, if you want people to find your application when they’re searching for “VAT reclaim on expenses,” hyperlink this phrase back to your App Center listing.

#### <a name="social-media-overview-twitter"></a>Twitter

SAP Concur will happily follow your company and would appreciate the same from you. If SAP Concur is using a hashtag to promote the partnership, we encourage your company to leverage the same hashtag related to the announcement(s). We also recommend including each other’s handle in the tweet, including “@” (for example, @SAPConcur). For any events, be sure to use the appropriate hashtag, such as #SAPConcurFusion as well.

#### <a name="social-media-facebook"></a>Facebook

You are welcome to promote all related integration with SAP Concur via your corporate Facebook pages. SAP Concur is pleased to “like” your company page and would appreciate the same from you. In addition to the visibility this provides to both our companies, adding “@” in front of the company name will allow the announcement to show up on our timelines.

**Please ensure blog posts, tweets and Facebook posts go out after any press releases are issued.**

* All Meta Tags within the website must state the company’s relationship with SAP Concur solutions without any ambiguity.
* The term “Concur” or “SAP Concur” (or another SAP Concur product name) cannot be the first word in the title tag.
* The tags should not mislead potential customers nor the Search crawlers into thinking that the site is an official representative of SAP Concur solutions.
* No party can use a web site that is confusingly similar to the official SAP Concur website, or which may mislead third parties into thinking the SAP Concur partner is part of the SAP Concur organization.
* Partner site may not use content duplicated or directly copied from pages on the official SAP Concur website(s).

#### <a name="search-seo-category-pages"></a>Category Pages

The App Center Marketing team has created search-optimized pages to drive more organic search traffic to partners.

Adding backlinks from reputable sites helps us increase our search ranking and visibility to prospects.

If you are in the below partner categories (more to be added in the future), please help us drive more traffic by linking to the following pages on your website:

* Cross-Border Payroll: [https://www.concur.com/multi-state-payroll](https://www.concur.com/multi-state-payroll)
* CFDI: [https://www.concur.com/cfdi-compliance](https://www.concur.com/cfdi-compliance)
* Life Sciences: [https://www.concur.com/open-payments-compliance](https://www.concur.com/open-payments-compliance)

If you are in the above categories, we will also add a link to your App Center listing from the SEO pages.

### <a name="search-paid"></a>Paid Search

* Use of Concur.com/AppCenter is permitted and encouraged.
* Partners who would like to mention SAP Concur anywhere in ad copy (headline, main copy or display URL) can do so with approval. If SAP Concur is mentioned, the ad must clearly state that you are an SAP Concur partner. Contact App Center marketing with your request for approval.
* Phrase and Exact matches may be acceptable if your keyword research identifies a specific phrase which targets our integrated solution (examples: “Concur VAT reclaim” or “Concur FCPA”). Contact App Center Marketing for approval before bidding.
* To keep advertising costs under control for all of us, partners should not bid on our SAP Concur brand names (concur or SAP concur) or brand misspells (concur, concure, concurs, etc.) or brand + products terms (concur expense, concur travel etc.) in any match type. That would cause prices for these terms to go up, and we shouldn’t have to pay more for our own brand terms. Non-brand, generic terms can be bid on by anyone.
* SAP Concur does not bid on competitor names as that can be an expensive and inefficient activity. Partners are also advised not to bid on SAP Concur competitors as that would result in competitors bidding on SAP Concur.
* Partners should never misrepresent the SAP Concur company, brands or pricing. All prices displayed in search engine results and landing pages should be accurate and match with the price listed.
* Paid keyword landing pages must clearly state that you are an SAP Concur partner. They must not mislead customers into thinking you are SAP Concur and/or are an exclusive or preferred SAP Concur partner.
* Partners must never state or imply that they are the “official site” of SAP Concur in any territories.
* Affected territories: These guidelines hold true for all search engines in all territories.
* Prohibited display URLs: Partners should not use the following URLs either as display URLs or as ad-landing URLs in any territories:

```
www.concur.com
www.concur.co.uk
www.concur.de
concur.fr
concur.com.au
concur.ca
concur.co.in
concur.com.hk
concur.com.sg,
