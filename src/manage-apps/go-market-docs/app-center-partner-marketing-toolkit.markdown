### <a name="social-media-overview"></a>Social Media Overview

In addition to issuing a press release highlighting your SAP Concur integration, we encourage you to promote it through social media channels. Please share all blog posts, Tweets and Facebook posts with App Center Marketing for approval. We will work with you to jointly promote your posts and better amplify the message.

> Please ensure blog posts, tweets and Facebook posts go out after any press releases are issued.

#### <a name="social-media-overview-blog-posts"></a>Blog posts

![Blog Image](./app-center-partner-marketing-toolkit-social-media-blog.png)

Blog posts are a great way to create keyword-heavy content that helps optimize your site for search engines in order to help people find you online and feature your integration with SAP Concur. We encourage these blog posts to include as many visuals, including screenshots of the application integration points, if possible. Links back to the SAP Concur website are also highly encouraged. Create content that clearly and accurately describes the integration and be thoughtful about which keywords are linked back to your App Center listing. For example, if you want people to find your application when they’re searching for “VAT reclaim on expenses,” hyperlink this phrase back to your App Center listing.

#### <a name="social-media-overview-twitter"></a>Twitter

![Twitter Logo](./app-center-partner-marketing-toolkit-social-media-twitter.png)

SAP Concur will happily follow your company and would appreciate the same from you. If SAP Concur is using a hashtag to promote the partnership, we encourage your company to leverage the same hashtag related to the announcement(s). We also recommend including each other’s handle in the tweet, including “@” (for example, @SAPConcur). For any events, be sure to use the appropriate hashtag, such as #SAPConcurFusion as well.

#### <a name="social-media-facebook"></a>Facebook

![Facebook Logo](./app-center-partner-marketing-toolkit-social-media-facebook.png)

You are welcome to promote all related integration with SAP Concur via your corporate Facebook pages. SAP Concur is pleased to “like” your company page and would appreciate the same from you. In addition to the visibility this provides to both our companies, adding “@” in front of the company name will allow the announcement to show up on our timelines.

### <a name="search-seo"></a>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

> New to Search Engine Optimization? Check out the [Beginner’s Guide to SEO](https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo).

* All meta tags used must clearly state that you are an SAP Concur partner, to not be confused with SAP Concur as its own entity.
* The terms “Concur”/"SAP Concur" (or another Concur product name) cannot be the first word in the title tag.
* The tags should not mislead audiences nor the search crawlers into thinking that the site is an official representative of SAP Concur.
* Do not use a website that is confusingly similar to the official SAP Concur website, or which may mislead audiences into thinking you are SAP Concur.

#### <a name="search-seo-category-pages"></a>Category Pages

The App Center Marketing team has created search-optimized pages to drive more organic search traffic to partners.

Adding backlinks from reputable sites helps us increase our search ranking and visibility to prospects.

If you are in the below partner categories (more to be added in the future), please help us drive more traffic by linking to the following pages on your website:

* VAT: [https://concur.com/reclaim-vat](https://concur.com/reclaim-vat)
* Cross-Border Payroll: [https://concur.com/multi-state-payroll](https://concur.com/multi-state-payroll)
* CFDI: [https://concur.com/cfdi-compliance](https://concur.com/cfdi-compliance)
* FCPA/Audit: [https://concur.com/fcpa-compliance](https://concur.com/fcpa-compliance)
* Life Sciences: [https://concur.com/open-payments-compliance](https://concur.com/open-payments-compliance)

If you are in the above categories, we will also add a link to your App Center listing from the SEO pages.

### <a name="search-paid"></a>Paid Search

* Use of Concur.com/AppCenter is permitted and encouraged.
* Partners who would like to mention SAP Concur anywhere in ad copy (headline, main copy or display URL) can do so with approval. If SAP Concur is mentioned, the ad must clearly state that you are an SAP Concur partner. Contact App Center marketing with your request for approval.
* Phrase and Exact matches may be acceptable if your keyword research identifies a specific phrase which targets our integrated solution (examples: “Concur VAT reclaim” or “Concur FCPA”). Contact App Center Marketing for approval before bidding.
* To keep advertising costs under control for all of us, partners should not bid on our SAP Concur brand names (concur or SAP concur) or brand misspells (concur, concure, concurs, etc.) or brand + products terms (concur expense, concur travel etc.) in any match type. That would cause prices for these terms to go up, and we shouldn’t have to pay more for our own brand terms. Non-brand, generic terms can be bid on by anyone.
* SAP Concur does not bid on competitor names as that can be an expensive and inefficient activity. Partners are also advised not to bid on SAP Concur competitors as that would result in competitors bidding on SAP Concur.
* Partners should never misrepresent the SAP Concur company, brands or pricing. All prices displayed in search engine results and landing pages should be accurate and match with the price listed.
* Paid keyword landing pages must clearly state that you are an SAP Concur partner. They must not mislead customers into thinking you are SAP Concur and/or are an exclusive or preferred SAP Concur partner.
* Partners must never state or imply that they are the “official site” of SAP Concur in any territories.
* Affected territories: These guidelines hold true for all search engines in all territories.
* Prohibited display URLs: Partners should not use the following URLs either as display URLs or as ad-landing URLs in any territories:

```
www.concur.com
www.concur.co.uk
www.concur.de
concur.fr
concur.com.au
concur.ca
concur.co.in
concur.com.hk
concur.com.sg,

concur.nl
concur.com/zh-hans-cn
concur.co.jp
etc.
```

## <a name="content-best-practices"></a>Content Best Practices

Content (landing pages, brochures, images, blog posts, etc.) should follow the following best practices:

* Easy to read
  * Not too much text – readers should be able to quickly digest the value and meaning
  * Text includes a call to action
  * Text is an appropriate size for the document or image
  * Text contrasts with the background (avoid light on light or dark on dark)
  * Make sure to spell-check and review your work!
* Visually appealing
  * Use images of appropriate resolution for each platform. Avoid blurry images!
  * Don’t stretch an image disproportionately. Never disproportionately stretch a logo
  * Avoid “busy” content – stick to simple fonts, colors, and backgrounds
* Brand-approved
  * Never use another company’s logo on external documents without permission
  * Follow SAP Concur logo & brand guidelines to refer to our partnership
* Search-optimized
  * Have an SEO strategy and keep SEO in mind when creating content
