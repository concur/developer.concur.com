# API Reference (Deprecated)

Concur has several APIs that are deprecated in favor of newer APIs. This documentation is provided for developers who need to support deprecated APIs in existing applications.

If you are creating a new application with Concur, please see our [API Reference page](/api-reference/) for supported API documentation.
