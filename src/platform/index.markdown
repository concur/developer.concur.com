Getting the most out of the SAP Concur platform is more than just knowing how to use the APIs to develop apps and services that integrate with SAP solutions. It's important to make sure the app you create works for your end users and that when it doesn't you can provide the necessary information to open a support ticket.

In this section you'll find cross-platform information that will allow you to optimize your developer and customer experiences. If you visit the site often you'll notice that much of the information in this section was previously published as release notes. We're compiling it here so that you don't need to search for it. Check back occasionally, as technology evolves we'll add new topics.
