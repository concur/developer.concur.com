* [Calling /users Bulk API](#usersbulk)


## <a name="company"></a>Obtain Company Token

Company is a top-level principal within Concur and you would be able to obtain an access token and a refresh token on a Company's behalf just like you would be able to with a User. Only one authorization flow is currently available for obtaining tokens for a Company, which is the [Password grant](/api-reference/authentication/apidoc.html#password_grant).

Instructions for obtaining a Company Token is here : https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/authentication/company-auth.html

## <a name="usersbulk"></a>Calling /users Bulk API

Once you have the Company Token, you would call the `/users/` endpoint to retrieve a list of users that belong to that company.

This endpoint will also return basic company information together with the list of users.
