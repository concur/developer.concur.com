## <a name="access_token"></a>Access Tokens

The Oauth2 service generates access tokens for authenticated users, applications or companies. The token returned in the Oauth2 response can be used to access protected resources on Concur's services.

The Oauth2 response can, depending on grant type contain these values:

Name | Type | Format | Description
-----|------|--------|------------
`expires_in`|`string`|-|The lifetime in seconds of the access token
`scope`|`string`|-|The scope of the access token as granted to the client application
`token_type`|`string`|-| The type of token returned. Value will be `Bearer`
`access_token`|`string`|-|Token used to access protected resources of Concur's services.
`refresh_token`|`string`|-|Refresh token required to request a new access token for a given user.
`geolocation`|`string`|-|The base URL for where the user profile lives. See [base URI](#base_uri) for usage.
`id_token`|`string`|-|The OCID Token in the JSON Web Token (JWT) format that describes the user or company

**Token Response**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Date: date-requested
Content-Length: 3397
Connection: Close
```

```json
{
  "expires_in": "3600",
  "scope": "app-scopes",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "access_token": "access_token",
  "refresh_token": "refresh_token",
  "id_token": "ocid_token",
  "geolocation": "https://us.api.concursolutions.com"
}
```


## <a name="obtain_token"></a>Obtaining a token

You can obtain a token for three different types of principals in the Concur universe.

* User
* Application
* Company

**Token Lifetime**

An `accessToken` has a one hour lifetime.

In order to obtain a token, the client application needs to call the Oauth2 endpoint using various `grants` depending on the authentication scenarios required. The full list of supported scenarios is provided below:

  * [Authorization grant](#auth_grant)
  * [Password grant](#password_grant)
  * [Client Credentials grant](#client_credentials)
  * [One Time Password grant](#otp_grant)

## <a name="refresh_token"></a>Refreshing a token


The refresh grant is used to refresh an access_token that has expired. This grant can be used anytime a refresh_token is returned in the response of another grant request. No user interaction is required.

**Token Lifetime**

A refresh token has a **six month** lifetime. If the refresh token expires, the client application must reinitiate the authorization process. When a refresh token is used to request a new access token, both a new access token as well as a new refresh token are returned in the response.

It is recommended that the client application use the refresh grant to request a new access token as the initial step of accessing protected resources of Concur's services.

**Refreshing the token**

To request a new access token using a valid refresh token, use the Oauth2 /token endpoint. Use the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type.

```
POST /oauth2/v0/token
```

**Post Body**

Name | Type | Format | Description
-----|------| ------ | -----------
`client_id`|`string` | `UUID` | **Required** The client applications client_id supplied by App Management
`client_secret`|`string` | `UUID` | **Required** The client applications client_secret supplied by App Management
`refresh_token`|`string` | `UUID` | **Required** An existing valid refresh token to be used to request a new access token
`scope`|`string` | | The client applications list of scopes
`grant_type`|`string` | | **Required** The grant type instructs the Oauth2 service how to process the request. For refresh token, the value must be `refresh_token`

**Request**

```http
POST /oauth2/v0/token HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Host: us.api.concursolutions.com
Connection: close
Content-Length: 437

POST BODY
client_id=your-client_id
&client_secret=your-client_secret
&grant_type=refresh_token
&refresh_token=valid-refresh_token
&scope=app-scope
```

**Response**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Date: date-requested
Content-Length: 3397
Connection: Close
```

```json
{
  "expires_in": "3600",
  "scope": "app-scopes",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "access_token": "access_token",
  "refresh_token": "refresh_token",
  "id_token": "ocid_token",
  "geolocation": "https://us.api.concursolutions.com"
}
```

## <a name="revoke_token"></a>Revoking a token

All refresh_tokens associated to a user for an application can be revoked by calling the `https://us.api.concursolutions.com/app-mgmt/v0/connections` endpoint with a `DELETE` action. You have to provide the User's `accessToken` in the Authorization Header as `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.

```
DELETE https://us.api.concursolutions.com/app-mgmt/v0/connections
```

**Request**

```shell
DELETE https://us.api.concursolutions.com/app-mgmt/v0/connections
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

**Response**

```shell
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

## <a name="manage_token"></a>Managing tokens

Refresh Tokens are UUID4 identifiers that allow your application to obtain a fresh `accessToken` on behalf of a user to access Concur's APIs.

```
e013335d-b4ce-4c43-a7e4-b67abc1adcb0
```

It is highly recommended that you store Refresh Tokens together with your user's authorization metadata in your application every time you obtain a new `refreshToken` as they might change depending on different scenarios.

FOR APP CENTER AND SUPPLIER PARTNERS supporting all geolocations, storing the authorization metadata, including the geolocation are REQUIRED.

## <a name="base_uri"></a>Base URIs

When making API calls, the appropriate base URI should be used. There are three different scenarios:
1. Obtaining a token for a user
2. Refreshing a token
3. Calling other APIs

The Base URI for obtaining a token will leverage your application's geolocation.  The Base URI for refreshing tokens and all other API calls will leverage the token's geolocation.

### <a name="base_uri_obtain_token"></a>Base URIs for Obtaining a Token
When your application is created, you will be provided with a client ID, secret and geolocation. When obtaining a token, your application should use the base URI for the geolocation in which your application exists.

There are two endpoints for each geolocation - one is the default (used for server-side calls) and the other should be used for client-side calls.

The full list of available token geolocations is below:

Environment | URI | Description
-----|------|------
US Production |`https://us.api.concursolutions.com/oauth2/v0` | Default for all API calls
WWW-US Production | `https://www-us.api.concursolutions.com/oauth2/v0` | Used by browsers during Authorization Code grant
EU Production |`https://emea.api.concursolutions.com/oauth2/v0` | Default for all API calls
WWW-EU Production | `https://www-emea.api.concursolutions.com/oauth2/v0` | Used by browsers during Authorization Code grant
China Production |`https://cn.api.concurcdc.cn/oauth2/v0`| Default for all API Calls
WWW-CN Production |`https://www-cn.api.concurcdc.cn/oauth2/v0`|Used by browsers during Authorization Code grant
US Implementation |`https://us-impl.api.concursolutions.com/oauth2/v0` | For customers who have Implementation servers in the US
EU Implementation |`https://emea-impl.api.concursolutions.com/oauth2/v0` | For customers who have Implementation servers in the EU


> **When obtaining the token, the token's geolocation will be included in the response. The token's geolocation should be stored along with the token. The Developer's app will then be able to make subsequent calls using the token and the correct end points based on the token's GEO location.**

### Base URIs for All Other Calls
When refreshing a token or when calling any other APIs, the token's geolocation should be used as the base URI.

**Note:** Client-side calls should use the www- variant of the base URI.

For example:
When obtaining a token, if the response was the below:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Date: date-requested
Content-Length: 3397
Connection: Close
```

```json
{
  "expires_in": "3600",
  "scope": "app-scopes",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "access_token": "access_token",
  "refresh_token": "refresh_token",
  "id_token": "ocid_token",
  "geolocation": "https://us.api.concursolutions.com"
}
```

When then calling the receipts API to post a receipt, your request should be made to https://us.api.concursolutions.com (if server side) or https://www-us.api.concursolutions.com (for clients).


## <a name="id_token"></a>ID Token

Authentication service will return an [OPENID](http://openid.net) compatible [ID token](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken) with every token request. This `id_token` is primarily used to describe information about a user or a company. You can obtain the userId from this token.

**Sample id_token:**

```json
{
  "aud": "e010e25d-b4ce-4ce3-a7e4-b670cb1adcb0",
  "concur.profile": "https://us.api.concursolutions.com/profile/v1/principals/76459ad3-f77b-4d98-a21a-55333c9179f0",
  "concur.version": 2,
  "concur.type": "user",
  "sub": "76459ad3-f77b-4d98-a21a-55333c9179f0",
  "iss": "https://us.api.concursolutions.com",
  "exp": 1485485529,
  "nbf": 1485481929,
  "at_hash": "351515a6482f4ee1",
  "iat": 1485481929
}
```

### Verifying an id_token
The Authentication service exposes [JWKs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517) that can be used to validate the id_token in the form of a JWT. Validating a JWT is described in detail in [RFC 7519 - sec 7.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-7.2)

This is the link to Concur's JSON Web Key for Oauth2. [https://www-us.api.concursolutions.com/oauth2/v0/jwks](https://www-us.api.concursolutions.com/oauth2/v0/jwks)

## <a name="auth_grant"></a>Authorization grant

The authorization grant is the regular 3-legged oauth2 grant and is defined in detail in [RFC6749 sec-4.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1). This grant requires the user to explicitly authenticate themselves and authorise the application initiating the grant.

The users *must be* able to authenticate themselves via a Concur username & password. Users will be challenged to login by an Oauth2 HTML page.

**Who should use it**
* 3rd party "partner" websites - or -
* non-Concur Applications - & -
* Applications that need explicit user authentication & authorization - & -
* Applications that can securely store a code, access_token & refresh_token


**Grant details**

`GET /oauth2/v0/authorize`

Name | Type | Format | Description
-----|------| ------ | -----------
  `client_id`|`string` | `UUID` | Applications client_id supplied by App Management
  `redirect_uri`|`string` | | The redirect URI for your application to continue with the Oauth2 flow
  `scope`|`string` | | List of scopes that application is asking for
  `response_type`|`string` | | `code`
  `state`|`string` | |

With this grant, the user has two authentication options:
1. Username and password
2. One-time link using a verified email address

With both options, once the user is successfully authenticated and the user authorizes your application, the user will be redirected to the redirect_URI specified in the initial /authorize call with a temporary token appended.

`<redirect_uri>?geolocation=<token_geolocation>&cc=<token>`

*If the user is not successfully authenticated or does not authorize the scopes for your application, an error code and description will be appended to the redirect URI. Please refer to the [Response Codes](#response_codes) section for more information.*

Your application must then exchange the temporary token for a long-lived token using the below.

`POST /oauth2/v0/token`

Name | Type | Format | Description
-----|------| ------ | -----------
`client_id`|`string` | `UUID` | Applications client_id supplied by App Management
`client_secret`|`string` | `UUID` | Applications client_secret supplied by App Management
`redirect_uri`|`string` | | The redirect_uri that is registered for the application
`code`|`string`| `UUID`  | The authorization code provided by Auth
`grant_type`|`string` | | `authorization_code`


**NOTE**

Because of certificate issues with browser requests through Authorization Grant, callers should use the https://www-us.api.concursolutions.com base URI instead.

## <a name="password_grant"></a>Password grant

The Password grant can be used when there is a trust relationship between the user and the application. There are two credential types allowed with Password Grant:

1. "Password": with this credential type, the application either already has the user's credentials or can obtain the user's credentials by directly interacting with the user.
1. "AuthToken": This credential type is used for connections from the App Center. For App Center partners and TripLink suppliers, please refer to the [certification documentation](/manage-apps/app-certification.html) for more information.

**Post Body**

Name | Type | Format | Description
-----|------| ------ | --------------
  `client_id`|`string` | `UUID` | Applications client_id supplied by App Management
  `client_secret`|`string` | `UUID` | Applications client_secret supplied by App Management
  `grant_type`|`string` | | Specify which grant type you expect the oauth2 service to process. for password grant, the value is `password`
  `username`|`string` | | specify the username or userId
  `password`|`string` | | specify the user's password
  `credtype`|`string` | | The credtype signifies to oauth2 which credential set is being submitted in the request. There are two supported values: `authtoken` and `password`. For connections from the App Center, use `authtoken`. if omitted, oauth2 will assume the type is `password`.

}
```


## <a name="otp_grant"></a>One Time Password grant


The One-time Password grant type leverages email, phone (text messaging), instant messaging and similar systems to provide per user access tokens to client applications. This grant type requires the following steps:

1. The calling application calls the OAuth2 service specifying the otp grant type along with required parameters.
2. The OAuth2 service generates a one time token which it sends through the messaging mechanism chosen by the application.
3. The user retrieves the token and presents it to the application. The means of having this presented to the application is the responsibility of the application.
4. The application presents this one-time token to the OAuth2 service via the token endpoint.


**Request a one-time token to be sent to the user**

Use the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type.

`POST /oauth2/v0/otp`

**Post Body**

Name | Type | Format | Description
-----|------|--------|------------
`client_id`|`string`|`UUID`|**Required** The client_id as defined in the Concur application management system.
`client_secret`|`string`|`UUID`|**Required** The client_secret as set by the client owner in the Concur application management system.
`channel_handle`|`string`|-|**Required** The location (email address, phone number) where the one time token should be sent. Currently, only `email address` is valid.
`channel_type`|`string`|-|**Required** The type of messaging system to use. Currently only `email` is valid
`name`|`string`|-|*Optional* The name of the user that appears in the email.
`company`|`string`|-|*Optional* The company or application name that appears in the email.
`link`|`string`|-|*Optional* The callback URL that appears in the email for users to click to complete the auth flow.


The calling application code can also append n-number of unique client defined parameters in the URI for the purpose of connecting the one time token to the application when received by the user. The names of these parameters cannot conflict with the API defined parameters.

The following are reserved words and cannot be used as client application defined parameters:

```
/otp: "client_id" "client_secret" "channel_type" "channel_handle"
```

```
/token: "client_id" "client_secret" "channel_type" "channel_handle" "scope" "grant_type" "otp"
```

If the calling application chooses to send custom parameters, all of these exact same parameters *must be* included in subsequent API calls to acquire the access token. In other words, the URI signature, modulo the one time token parameter itself and token service specific parameters, *must match* the originating URI signature.

**Request**

```http
POST /oauth2/v0/otp HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Accept: application/json
Host: us.api.concursolutions.com
Connection: close

Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 22
Date: date-requested
```

```json
{
  "message": "otp sent"
}
```


**Request an access token**

The One Time Password grant requires that all of the parameters, including client application defined parameters to be sent in the request body when requesting an access token. Use the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type.

`POST oauth2/v0/token`

**Post Body**

`client_secret`|`string`|`UUID`|**Required** The client_secret as set by the client owner in the Concur application management system.
`channel_handle`|`string`|-|**Required** The location (email address, phone number) where the one time token should be sent.
`channel_type`|`string`|-|**Required** The type of messaging system to use. Currently only `email` is valid
`scope`|`string`|-| The scope(s) requested by the client for the token.
`grant_type`|`string`|-|**Required** The grant type being used, specifically for this approach: `otp`.
`otp`|`string`|-|**Required** The one-time token provided as a result of the **Send a one time token to the user** method.

In order to assist with troubleshooting, Concur responds with a unique correlationId in the response header. The key to look for is `correlationid`. This unique code can be used during troubleshooting as it identifies the API call in the log files. You should record this information in your own API call logs as well so that you can pass this information on to the Concur support team.

Example of the `correlationid` in the response:

```
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Server: cnqr-papeete
< Date: Mon, 04 Dec 2017 22:07:05 GMT
< Content-Type: application/json
< Content-Length: 2897
< Connection: keep-alive
< Concur-Correlationid: 2803b8f8-a42b-43c2-a739-b8768e4759b8
```

Only the [Password Grant Type](#password_grant) is available for obtaining company-level tokens.

1. To begin the authentication flow, a Customer's Concur Administrator clicks on the Connect button within the App Center listing and authorizes the partner's app.  This app listing is located within customer's Concur system's App Center tab.
1. Concur's authorization service will redirect the Admin to the Partner’s Landing Page.  Partners should follow the [App Center UX Guidelines](https://developer.concur.com/manage-apps/go-market-docs/app-center-ux-guidelines-enterprise.html) to create a web page that listens for an HTTP GET request from Concur.
1. The redirect URI will contain an id, requestToken and userId parameters.  Example: `https://{partner_redirect_URI}?id=8568a4cd-8ffc-49d6-9417-be2d69aa075f&requestToken=5l85ae5a-426f-4d6f-8af4-08648c4b696b&userId=9bdded51-00b8-4f84-8bef-6d3afe727007`
1. When the Partner application receives the redirect call, the Partner should strip the `id` and `requestToken` values from the URI and use those on a Post request to the Concur Authorization service to obtain the official Oauth2 Access Token and Refresh Token for the customer using the [password grant](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/authentication/apidoc.html#password_grant). As explained in detail in this [presentation](https://prezi.com/p/lw0qqy51zcmd/), the Partner must have [Data Center Geo Awareness](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/authentication/apidoc.html#base_uri) related to the token. We currently have 3 Data Centers and the API end points change based on these Data Centers so it is imperative the proper token management is followed.  Otherwise, your app will not make the correct call per Access token.
1. An access token is valid for only one hour.  The access token should be cached in memory and discarded after use.
1. After the Admin has successfully completed the login/enrollment process, the Partner should store the following elements with the customer’s profile metadata.
  * `refresh_token`: (36 characters including dashes) Valid for six months from the day and time issued.
  * `refresh_expires_in`: This is Epoch time format, convert to UTC.
  * `geolocation`: To be used when making API calls on behalf of the customer.
  * `id`: Aka `sub`, is the customer’s unique identifier (UUID).  It can be retrieved from the following sources:
    * From the re-direct URI as the id element.
    * By decoding the `id_token` returned with Access token, as the `sub` element. (See https://jwt.io)
1. It is highly recommended that Partners log the following elements:
  * `userId`: the user who clicked on the Connect button (returned in the re-direct URI)
  * `correlationid`: Concur responds with a unique code which identifies the API call in the log files.  (returned in the response header).  More details can be found here.
