### <a name="endpoint-behavior"></a>Endpoint Behavior
The Event Subscription Service provides guaranteed at least once event delivery.  This is accomplished through retrying posting of the event payload to the subscribers' endpoint until the response indicates successful receipt.  The expected acknowledgment max for a request to the subscribers' endpoint is 30 seconds.  The service will attempt posting to the endpoint and then back-off and retry until the subscriber endpoint responds with delivered or not accepted.  Concur suggests the subscriber endpoint implement the following behavior characteristics.
Ensure endpoint responds as quickly as possible (< 3 seconds)
Subscriber must maintain reasonable uptime to support the requirements of the integration scenario
If the subscriber must have durability of delivered events these must be persisted on the subscriber side
If the subscriber action on the event is non-idempotent or expensive guard against a duplicate event by checking the event Id has not already been processed.
