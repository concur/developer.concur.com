## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

SAP Concur partners with external payment providers for processing invoice payments. These payment providers are listed on the App Center and can integrate with the Invoice product by using the Invoice Pay APIs. Payment providers can get a list of all the payments authorized to be processed by them, and send back status of those payments.
> **Limitations**: This API is available only in the North America Data Center.

## <a name="scope-usage"></a>Scope Usage

Name|Description|Endpoint
---|---|---
`invoice.providerpayment.write`|Read access to pending payments, and write access to payment status|GET,POST

## <a name="dependencies"></a>Dependencies

This API can only be used with SAP Concur clients who have purchased Concur Invoice.

## <a name="access-token-usage"></a>Access Token Usage

This API supports only Company access tokens.

## <a name="obtain-payment"></a>Obtaining payments

Payment providers can use this endpoint to get a list of payments.
* This method will return all payments with a status [PENDING_RETRIEVAL](#schema-payment-update-status) and payment method `PAVPVD`. After an invoice is approved and extracted it will be converted into a payment with status [PENDING_RETRIEVAL](#schema-payment-update-status).
* It returns a maximum of 500 records at a time. In order to ensure that all payments are retrieved, call this method until you receive an empty payment in the response.
* The payment provider will need to acknowledge that payments were received, using [Updating a Payment With Status](#updating-payment) and updating the status of the payment to any status other than [PENDING_RETRIEVAL](#schema-payment-update-status).
