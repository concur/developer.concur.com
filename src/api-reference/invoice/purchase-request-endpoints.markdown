{% include prerelease.html %}

The Purchase Request API gives clients the ability to leverage external data to create Concur Invoice purchase requests for pre-authorization. Clients and Partners can build a direct connection where data can be fed to the purchase request API which will create new purchase requests in Concur. These API-created purchase requests are automatically submitted into the Concur Invoice pre-authorization workflow. Once approved, it will result in a Concur Invoice purchase order that can be transmitted to your Vendor from Concur Invoice. 

In addition a Get Status endpoint is provided that can be used to get basic information and check the status of the created purchase request. 

> **Limitations**: This API does not support users in the China data center.

## <a name="access-token-usage"></a>Access Token Usage

This API will work with both Company or User access tokens, however a Company `access token` is recommended for integrations using this API if the end goal is for the integration to create purchase requests for multiple requestors. When using a User `access token` to create purchase requests through the API it will result in the purchase request being assigned to the user that generated the User `access token` and it will not honor the user set in the payload. A User `access token` could be used for testing to check if your payloads are good if needed. For an integration as mentioned above a Company `access token` is the best choice.   

## <a name="post"></a>Create a new purchase request  

    POST  /purchaserequest/v4/purchaserequests

Create a Purchase Request based on provided header and line item details. If the request is valid it returns back a unique identifier to look at purchase request details and creates a purchase request in back ground.
