# Company
The Concur's **company** API is used to help provision and manage companies and their profile details across multiple Concur products, including Expense, Invoice, Request, and Travel.

* [Schema Definition](#scim)
* [Get Company](#get)
* [Response Codes](#codes)

### Version
1.0

## <a name="scim"></a>Schema Definition

The Company schema is inspired by the work from [SCIM](https://tools.ietf.org/wg/scim/) (System for Cross-domain Identity Management), in particular, [RFC 7643](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7643) & optionally [RFC 7644](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644).

The latest version of the Company schema is always available at: [company.json](company.json).

## <a name="get"></a>Get Company

Each company in Profile is associated with a unique UUID. And your company access token will limit the company you can query for. You can use the following endpoint to lookup your company:

    GET /profile/v1/me     (access token required)


Curl example:


    curl -k -v -H "Authorization: Bearer $access-token" "https://$host/profile/v1/me"
