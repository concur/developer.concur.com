## Overview

The goal of this API is to allow customers and 3rd party vendors to add their traveler's location data to Concur Locate so it can be utilized locate and contact travelers to address their duty of care requirements.

This API supports POST only.

## Prerequisites

1. [Obtain a client ID, secret and sandbox environment](/manage-apps/partner-applications.html) if you don't already have one.
2. Obtain your [Source partner](#sourcePartner) information. This will be provided along with your application credentials.
3. This API supports all Valid JWTs whether they be company level, password grants or client_credentials grant. Read the [Getting Started](/api-reference/authentication/getting-started.html) section of [Authentication API](/api-reference/authentication/apidoc.html) for details. Your sandbox will be configured to accept posts from your application.


## Service Details
 The service is a POST call adhering to the following steps:
 
* Vendor onboarding has been completed prior to invoking the API. All the authentication and authorization credentials have been set up at this point.
* Third party vendors invoke the User Location API using the client credentials (JWT)
* Since the new service is registered with API gateway, the call is intercepted by the API Gateway and basic authentication and authorization for the given client credentials (JWT) is done
* If the checks fail, then the appropriate error response is returned to the caller.
* If the checks pass, then the request is forwarded to the load balancer which routes the request to the appropriate node for processing
* The selected node processes the request which is in JSON format. Validations are performed the data conversion takes place. If any of the validations fail, then the appropriate error response is returned to the client (HTTP 400 Bad Request / HTTP 403 Unauthorized)
* If the validations pass, then the request is processed, and the data is persisted to the backend (DB) in the following ways:
    * Direct persistence
    * Persistence via queues
* If the persistence is successful, then an HTTP 200 OK is returned to the caller
* If there are any issues with the persistence, then the appropriate codes are returned to the caller (HTTP 500 Application exception)
* Note that the error messages are intentionally ambiguous to prevent exploitation
