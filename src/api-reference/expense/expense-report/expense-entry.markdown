For expense types with an expense code that uses a transaction amount instead of a distance, this element is required. This element should not be used for expense types with an expense code for Company Car or Personal Car, because these two expense codes always use the Cash payment type.

For expense types with an expense code that uses a transaction amount instead of a distance, this element is required.

`TransactionDate`	|	`DateTime`	|	required	|	The Date when the good or service associated with this expense entry was provided. Format: YYYY-MM-DD
`TripID`	|	`string`	|	-	|	The unique identifier of a trip in the Itinerary Service that includes a travel booking associated with this expense. Use GET ItineraryDetails to get information about this trip and the travel booking. This element is null when there is no trip associated with the expense.
