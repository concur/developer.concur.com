The Expense Entry Attendees manages the relationship between the attendees and the expense report and entry, for the specified expense entry. This resource does not include the full attendee information, which can be accessed using the Get Attendees function.

## URI

```
https://www.concursolutions.com/api/expense/expensereport/v2.0/report/{reportID}/entry/{entryID}/attendees
```

## PUT Expense Entry Attendees

This allows the developer to specify which existing attendees are associated to the specified entry. It also gives the developer the option to provide the values for the Entry-Attendee association. The list of attendees in the request will replace any existing associated attendees, so the developer must include all attendees in the request. This function cannot be used to create new attendees.
