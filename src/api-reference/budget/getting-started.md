### <a name="overview"></a>Overview

The Budget service exposes budget and fiscal year data.  Partners may use the service endpoints to read and alter fiscal year, budget, budget adjustment, and budget matching configuration.
Summary and detailed balance amounts are also available to read, but may not be altered via the API.

The sequence to configure budgets is to first setup the fiscal year and then the budget categories (if applicable) before creating budget items.
Budget items may use budget tracking fields as filters. The budget tracking field can only be configured in the application UI. Also budget owner,
approver and budget viewer permissions have to be assigned to users prior to configuring budgets.

#### <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

1. [Create a sandbox](https://developer.concur.com/manage-apps/register.html) if you don't already have one.
2. Read the [Getting Started](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/authentication/getting-started.html) section of [Authentication API](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/authentication/apidoc.html).

Once you have registered your application, read about the [Budget Category](/api-reference/budget/budget-category.html), [Fiscal Year](/api-reference/budget/fiscal-year.html), [Budget Tracking Field](/api-reference/budget/budget-trackingfield.html), [Budget Adjustment](/api-reference/budget/budget-adjustments.html) and [Budget Item Header](/api-reference/budget/budget-header.html) endpoints.

#### <a name="retrieve-a-user-access-token"></a>Retrieve a User Access Token:

Before making requests to the Budget API, you must [obtain an access token from the Authentication API](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/authentication/getting-started.html).

The response will include an `access_token` field, which contains your access token. For subsequent calls, you will need to include this access token in the `Authorization` header of your calls. An `id_token` will be also included in the response. In order to retrieve the unique ID for your user, you will have to decode this `id_token` at [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/). You will need this ID in order to access the Budget endpoints.

Examples:

#### Request
```http
POST https://us.api.concursolutions.com/oauth2/v0/token
client_secret:{YOUR SECRET}
client_id:{YOUR CLIENT ID}
grant_type:password
username:{YOUR USERNAME}
password:{YOUR PASSWORD}
```

#### <a name="roles-and-scopes"></a>Roles and Scopes:
