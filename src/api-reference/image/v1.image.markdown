* [Post an image](#post-image)
* [Get an image URL](#get-image-url)

The Concur Imaging Web service allows clients to manage the receipt images attached to expense reports and the images attached to invoices. Clients can retrieve existing images by reportID, image ID, or invoiceID, and upload new images to a user, expense entry, report, or invoice.

The Imaging web service supports the following image formats:

* `application/pdf` which has not been encrypted or password protected.
* `image/jpg`
* `image/jpeg`
* `image/png`

The maximum file size allowed is 10 MB.

## Product Restrictions

Concur products are highly configurable, and not all clients will have access to all features.

Partner developers must determine which configurations are required for their solution prior to the review process.

Existing clients can work with Concur Advantage Technical Services to create custom applications that work with their configuration.

## <a name="schema"></a>Schema

### <a name="schema-image"></a>Image

The Image schema provides metadata about an image within the system.

Name|Type|Format|Description
---|---|---|---
`Id`|`string`|-|The unique identifier of the image.
`Url`|`string`|-|The URL for the image. Note that special characters will be XML-encoded. You will need to unencode any special characters before using the link. This element is empty when uploading images.

## C# Code Example

The following example in C# illustrates how to read the source image file as an array of bytes and pass that data into the request.

```csharp
HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(url);
request.Method = "POST";
request.ContentType = "application/pdf";
request.Headers.Add("Authorization", signature);

using (FileStream fs = new FileStream(pathToImageFile, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read))
{
	using (BinaryReader br = new BinaryReader(fs))
	{
		byte[] image = br.ReadBytes((int)fs.Length);
		request.ContentLength = image.Length;

		Stream ds = request.GetRequestStream();
		ds.Write(image, 0, image.Length);
		ds.Close();
	}
}

HttpWebResponse webresponse = request.GetResponse();
```
