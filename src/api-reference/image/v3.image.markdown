The SAP Concur Receipt Image API allows for the management of receipt images attached to expense reports, expense entries, and payment requests. You can retrieve existing images by Image ID, and upload new images to a User. This API allows you to upload images in a predefined format and size targeting a specific resource or user in SAP Concur. You can also pull images down from SAP Concur by either displaying them in the browser or downloading the image content to save locally.

> **Note**: This API is not designed to obtain the receipt images attached to an expense report. If you are an Enterprise Partner creating integrations that are intended to obtain final-approved Expense or Invoice data, and the accompanying receipt images that substantiate those transactions you will need to use [Image v1](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/image/v1.image.html). These scenarios include, but are not limited to: ERP integrations for financial journal entry postings, VAT reclaim integrations that obtain transactions to calculate VAT reclaim, project billing integrations used to substantiate expenses billed back, etc.
