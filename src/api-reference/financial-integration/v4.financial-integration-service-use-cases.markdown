## <a name="undv"></a>Non-Deductible VAT

#### Description

If a receipt of an expense item does not fulfill all legal requirements (for example, see UStG § 14 paragraph 4 for German requirements) or doesn’t fulfill other legal requirements (for example, see UStG § 15 paragraph 1a sentence 1) then the VAT that is mentioned on the receipt is not deductible.

Within an SAP ERP system there are 3 options how this non-deductible VAT could be posted:

* Post VAT to a separate expense account.
* Include VAT in expense posting - Show the VAT amount in tax reporting.
* Include VAT in expense posting - Don’t show the VAT amount in tax reporting.

How the VAT is handled is determined based on the Tax Code customization in ERP.

#### Posting Example

Expense report with a hotel receipt that does not include the company address.

## <a name="updv"></a>Partially Deductible VAT

#### Description

In some cases it could be possible that the whole VAT amount is not deductible. In this case the postings have similar posting options as Non-deductible VAT.

#### Posting Example

For a hotel receipt of EUR 230 (including 15% - EUR 30 VAT) the VAT is only deductible by 50%.

## <a name="uferwv"></a>Foreign Expense Report Without VAT

#### Description

If an employee from a country with VAT enters a foreign receipt and the included VAT is not claimable the document has to be posted with a 0% VAT tax code. In Concur Expense this tax code is normally customized for the tax authority in the non-domestic code field.

#### Posting Example

German employee enters a receipt for US-based training. In this case, independent from the VAT mentioned on the receipt, the document has to be posted with 0% but with a valid tax code.

## <a name="uitem"></a>Itemization

## <a name="uiei"></a>Itemized Expense Items

#### Description

An original receipt is split into several parts, for example, a hotel receipt is split into the lodging costs per night, breakfast, and other costs.

All items should be processed separately. This means for every line item the VAT should be calculated. The VAT for all items could be posted separately or within one posting line.

#### Posting Example

For a hotel receipt of EUR 214 (including 7% - EUR 14 VAT) the costs per night should be posted separately.

## <a name="ucosta"></a>Cost Allocation

## <a name="uewca"></a>Expense Without Cost Allocation

#### Description

Entering a cost allocation is not mandatory in Concur Expense. The cost allocation screen can even be completely deactivated.

In that case it is necessary to check first if a cost object assignment is available on expense entry level. This could be available within the Org  fields or in the Custom fields.

If there is no information available then it is necessary to check the corresponding fields on expense report header level and as last instance the employee master data.

## <a name="ucasha"></a>Cash Advances

## <a name="uissue"></a>Issuance

### <a name="upaidc"></a>Paid Cash

## <a name="uapp"></a>Application

### <a name="ucaltp"></a>Cash Advance Is Lower Than the Payout Amount

#### Description

The employee enters an expense report and assigns a cash advance. This cash advance reduces the employee’s payout amount. Only the difference between the sum of the expense items paid by the employee and the cash advance will be paid to the employee.

#### Posting Example

The user has gone to an ATM and withdrawn USD 300 in cash on the corporate card. In the course of travel the user incurs the following cash expenses: USD 245 on a rental car, USD 60 on a business meal, and USD 10 on parking. After returning from travel the user finds the USD 300 cash advance has been issued via the corporate card import process. He assigns the USD 300 cash advance to an expense report and enters the three cash expenses and submits. The expenses are not itemized. The expenses are legitimate business expenses.

### <a name="ucahtp"></a>Cash Advance Is Higher Than the Payout Amount

#### Description

The employee enters an expense report and assigns a cash advance. If the cash advance is higher than the sum of the expense items paid by the employee, the employee owes the difference to the company.

#### Posting Example

The user has requested and received a USD 400 cash advance and in the course of travel spends USD 245 on a rental car, USD 60 on a business meal, and USD 10 on parking. The user assigns the USD 400 cash advance to the expense report and enters the three cash expenses and submits. The expenses are not itemized. The expenses are legitimate business expenses. Because the total of the cash advance exceeds the sum of the business expenses the net result of the expense report is that the employee owes the company the balance. The employee will write a check to the company for the balance (USD 85) and enter a Cash Advance Return transaction in that amount to net the Expense Report to zero.

## <a name="udocsp"></a>Document Splits

## <a name="uinterp"></a>Intercompany Postings

#### Description

An employee enters an expense report including a cost object assignment for a
different company code. These costs should be automatically assigned to the correct company code. This requires a posting split because the vendor and reconciliation postings still have to be done in the origin company code.

If the cost object belongs to a company code that does not belong to the same ERP system, this use case will not be supported.

We will only support the SAP standard I/Co posting process that can be set up in transaction OBYA. In this case the posting will be automatically split and offset accounts will be automatically added based on the OBYA customizing.

## <a name="ungls"></a>New G/L Split

#### Description

Similar to the posting split that is done by for the I/Co processing it may be necessary to split a posting in case the New G/L functionality is activated in ERP and the expense report posting includes multiple offset accounts (vendors, reconciliation accounts). In this case a splitting is required, too.

For a coding example you can look at the CfTE method CL_DCFL_FIN_PREPROC_INIT_TV-\> SPLIT_DOCUMENT
