### <a name="#esopce"></a>Simple Out-of-Pocket Cash Expense

The Payer in this instance is the company; the Payee is the employee. Since it is not an itemized expense the **Entry Transaction Type** is REG. Because it is a legitimate business expense the ‘**Is Personal**’ flag is set to ‘N’. The employee will be reimbursed for this transaction.

#### Extract Details

For the expense line: The Payer in this instance is the company; the Payee is the employee. Since it is not an itemized expense the **Entry Transaction Type** is REG. Because it is a legitimate business expense the ‘**Is Personal**’ flag is set to ‘N’. The employee will be reimbursed for this transaction. The **Tax Code** will also appear on this detail line along with the Tax Authority details (label and name).

Tax data: The appearance of the tax data in the extract is governed by the
Extract options to either include tax information in the same detail line as the entry on which tax is calculated, or to include it as a separate journal line. In this example Tax is set to appear as a journal line. The Payer is the notional Tax Authority with the Payee as the company (as the reclaimed tax will eventually be paid by the tax authority to the company).

The **Journal Amount** on the Tax detail line can be set to either list the amount eligible to reclaim on either the Posted or Adjusted (`reclaim_posted_amount` or `reclaim_adjusted_amount`) . If ‘Adjusted’ the tax reclaim will be calculated on the Approved amount (the approved amount may be lower than the claimed (posted) amount). The Tax source identifies the source of the Tax calculation.

The **Tax Code** can also be set to appear in the **Account Code** field on the Tax detail line (instead of the account code), this is shown in this example. The difference between the ‘reclaim’ fields (`reclaim_tax_amount`, `reclaim_posted_amount`, `reclaim_adjusted_amount`) and other tax amount fields (`tax_amount`, `tax_posted_amount`, etc.) is that ‘Reclaim’ indicates that these figures are subject to the Reclaim percentage specified in the Tax configuration. For example: if a reclaim rate is set at 50% the `tax_posted_amount` and the `reclaim_posted_amount` would be GBP 100 and GBP 50 for a calculated **Tax Amount** of GBP 100.

*Issuance Extract (For reference only. Issuance is not included in the Expense Report FI Document)*

There will be one issuance record for each cash advance issued. The issuance record can be identified by the **Cash Advance Transaction Type** which will always be a ‘1’. The Payer is the Company and the Payee is the Employee. The **Journal Amount** is a DR transaction in the reimbursement currency. The **Cash Advance Amount** is the amount of the cash advance in the currency of issuance. The **Account Code** is the employee cash advance account code, which is an element of the employee profile.

This case will likely manifest itself in two separate extracts (especially if extracts are run daily): the first extract will contain the cash advance issuance and the second extract will contain the application of that cash advance on an expense report. The first extract will contain the data on the ATM withdrawal transaction and will appear in the first scheduled extract after the credit card cash advance transaction has been downloaded from the card vendor. The second extract will contain the transactions to which the cash advance was applied. These transactions will be part of an expense report and will be extracted at the time the expense report is approved for payment.

There will be one issuance record for each ATM cash withdrawal. The issuance record can be identified by the **Cash Advance Transaction Type** which will always be a ‘1’. The Payer is the Company and the Payee is the Employee. The **Journal Amount** is a DR transaction in the reimbursement currency. The **Cash Advance Amount** is the amount of the cash advance in the currency of issuance. The **Account Code** is the clearing account code which was configured for the CBCP corporate card payment type.

### <a name="#ecailt"></a>Cash Advance Is Lower Than the Payout Amount

The application phase of this case will generate five records in the standard extract file. Three of the records will cover the three cash out-of-pocket transactions. These three transactions are handled in the same way all cash, out-of-pocket transactions are handled (Simple Out-of-Pocket Cash Expense).

The two additional records are unique to an expense report containing a Cash Advance. The system will attempt to recover the cash advance amount from the employee by creating credit records against the cash transactions until the total of the cash advance is recovered. In this example, the first cash advance record (`entry_id` 1243) credits the entire USD 245 of its companion record (`entry_id` 1240). That still leaves USD 55 of the cash advance unrecovered. So another credit record (`entry_id` 1244) in the amount of USD 55 will be created against the next companion cash expense record (`entry_id` 1241). At this point
the USD 300 cash advance has been recovered. The credit journal amounts have the effect of offsetting the total amount due the employee by the amount of the cash advance.

These offset records will have the following characteristics: the Payer is the employee; the Payee is the company. The **Debit/Credit** indicator will always be ‘CR’. The **Cash Advance Amount** field will always contain the total of the cash advances applied to the expense report. The **Cash Advance Transaction Type** will be a ‘2’. The employee will receive the net of the total cash expenses less the cash advance amount; in this example, USD 22.

### <a name="#ecaiht"></a>Cash Advance Is Higher Than the Payout Amount

The application phase of this case will generate seven records in the standard extract file. Three of the records will cover the three cash out-of-pocket transactions. These three transactions are handled in the same way all cash, out-of-pocket transactions are handled (Simple Out-of-Pocket Cash Expense).

The four additional records are unique to an expense report containing a Cash Advance. The system will attempt to recover the cash advance amount from the employee by creating credit records against the cash transactions until the total of the cash advance is recovered. In this example, since the total of all expenses does not equal or exceed the cash advance amount, all three expense records have a corresponding offset credit. That still leaves the user USD 78 short. The **Cash Advance Return** record in the amount of a USD 78 credit nets the cash advance amount to zero.

These offset records will have the following characteristics: the Payer is the employee; the Payee is the company. The **Debit/Credit** indicator will always be ‘CR’. The **Cash Advance Amount** field will always contain the total of the cash advances applied to the expense report. The **Cash Advance Transaction Type** will be a ‘2’. The employee will receive the net of the total cash expenses less the cash advance amount and in the case of a net due to company the employee will be required to submit a **Cash Advance Return** to retire the balance owed; in this example, USD 78.

## <a name="#ecci"></a>Credit Card Items

SAP Concur recognizes 3 different types of credit cards:

* IBIP - Individual Bill - Individual Payment: Paid by employee

* IBCP - Individual Bill - Company Payment: Split payment

* CBCP - Company Bill - Company Payment: Paid by company

### <a name="#epvccva"></a>Payment via Credit Card Vendor Account (Split Payment)

The Payer in this instance is the company; the Payee is the corporate card vendor. Since it is not an itemized expense the **Entry Transaction Type** is REG. Because it is a legitimate business expense the ‘**Is Personal**’ flag is set to ‘N’. Because this is an IBCP transaction and the payment will be made to the card vendor on behalf of the employee the employee will not receive reimbursement.

### <a name="#eiwpe"></a>IBCP With Personal Expense: No Out-of-Pocket

The Payer in this instance is the company; the Payee is the corporate card vendor. Since it is an itemized expense the **Entry Transaction Type** is ‘CHD’.

The remaining expenses are legitimate business expenses, thus the ‘**Is Personal**’ flag is set to ‘N’. Because this is an IBCP transaction and the payment will be made to the card vendor on behalf of the employee the employee will not receive reimbursement.

### <a name="#eiwoegt"></a>IBCP (With Offsets) With Personal Expense: Out-of-Pocket Greater Than Personal Expense

The Payer for both transactions is the company. The Payee is the corporate card vendor for the legitimate business expenses on the Hotel transaction (the Hotel expenses and the Dinner expense). Because the reimbursement method is IBCP with offsets, the card vendor will also be the payee for the personal expenses on the Hotel transaction up to the total amount of out-of-pocket cash expense submitted on this expense report. Since the non-reimbursable in-room movie expense (USD 14) is less than the total out-of-pocket cash expenses (USD 35) owed to the employee, the company will pay the USD 14 personal expense to the card vendor and offset that amount against the USD 35 owed to the employee. Thus the employee will only receive USD 21 of the USD 35 Taxi expense. In this case there were enough out-of-pocket cash expenses to offset the non-reimbursable expenses so there is a net due to the employee for this expense report.

### <a name="#eiwolt"></a>IBCP (With Offsets) With Personal Expense: Out-of-Pocket Less Than Personal Expense

The Payer for both transactions is the company. The Payee is the corporate card vendor for the legitimate business expenses on the Hotel transaction (the Hotel expenses and the Dinner expense). Because the reimbursement method is IBCP w/offsets, the card vendor will also be the payee for the personal expenses on the Hotel transaction up to the total amount of out-of-pocket cash expense submitted on this expense report. Since the non-reimbursable in-room movie expense (USD 14) is greater than the total out-of-pocket cash expenses (USD 5) owed to the employee, the company will pay only USD 5 of the USD 14 personal expense to the card vendor and offset that amount against the USD 5 owed to the employee. Thus the employee will not receive any reimbursement and will personally owe the card vendor for the difference between the USD 5 paid by the company on his behalf and the USD 14 charge, or USD 9. In this case there were not enough out-of-pocket cash expenses to offset the non-reimbursable expenses so the employee is responsible to make up the difference with the card vendor.

### <a name="#ecvea"></a>Clearing via Expense Account

The Payer in this instance is the company; the Payee is Company Paid. It is not an itemized expense thus the **Entry Transaction Type** is REG. Because it is a legitimate business expense the ‘**Is Personal**’ flag is set to ‘N’. Because this transaction has already been paid by the Company the employee will not receive reimbursement.

### <a name="#eccccep"></a>CBCP Corporate Card Charge for Entirely Personal Expense (Net Due Company With and Without Offsets)

The extract produces two records for this single transaction. One record addresses payment that must be made to the card vendor by the company. The Payer is the company. The Payee is the corporate card vendor. The amount is a debit of USD 53 to the clearing account. Since there are no employee out-of-pocket expenses on this expense report there is nothing to offset the amount that the employee owes the company. Therefore, a separate record is created to address the net due company condition. In this record the Payer is the employee and the Payee is the company. The amount is a credit of USD 53 to the clearing account. The company’s financial system must have a process for dealing with this employee receivable condition. The CT&E system will not “carry over” this net due company amount to subsequent expense reports.

### <a name="#eccccwi"></a>CBCP Corporate Card Charge with Itemization and Personal Expense (Net Due Employee With Offsets)

The Payer for both transactions is the company. The Payee is the corporate card vendor for the full amount of the Hotel transaction (the company owes the card vendor for the entire amount of the transaction, including the non-reimbursable in-room movie) and the Employee for the balance of the Taxi expense after the offset is taken for the in-room movie portion of the corporate card transaction. The employee would normally be reimbursed for the full USD 35 out-of-pocket taxi expense but, because a portion of the company paid corporate card transaction was not a legitimate business expense, the system reduces the amount due to the employee by the amount of the non-reimbursable expense. In this case there was enough out-of-pocket cash expenses to offset the non-reimbursable expenses so there is a net due to the employee for this expense report.

### <a name="#eccccip"></a>CBCP Corporate Card Charge With Itemization and Personal Expense (Net Due Employee Without Offsets)

The records are slightly different from CBCP Corporate Card Charge with Itemization and Personal Expense (Net Due Employee With Offsets)where offsets are built into the extract. In this case, where there are no built-in offsets, each record is distinct and the offset will need to be calculated in the client’s bridge program. The Payer for both transactions is the company except for the personal portion of the Hotel expense. The personal amount of USD 14 is represented with two distinct records. One record addresses the amount due to the corporate card vendor to ensure that the full amount of the Hotel transaction (including the personal amount) is paid to the card vendor. A second offsetting record addresses the same personal amount that the employee owes back to the company. In the first record, the Company is the Payer and the Payee is the corporate card vendor for the USD 14 non-reimbursable in-room movie). In the second record the Employee is the Payer and the Payee is the Company for the credit amount of the USD 14 non-reimbursable in-room movie. The full USD 35 out-of-pocket taxi expense is handled as a normal out-of-pocket cash expense with the Company being the Payer and the Employee being the Payee. The client’s bridge program will need to summarize the two records (USD +35 taxi and USD -14 in-room movie) to arrive at the USD 21 due to the employee.

### <a name="#eccccep"></a>CBCP Corporate Card Charge for Entirely Personal Expense (Net Due Company Without Offsets)

The extract produces two records for this single transaction. One record addresses payment that must be made to the card vendor by the company. The Payer is the company. The Payee is the corporate card vendor. The amount is a debit of USD 53 to the clearing account. The second record is created to address the net due company condition. In this record the Payer is the employee and the Payee is the company. The amount is a credit of USD 53 to the clearing account. The company’s financial system must have a process for dealing with this employee receivable condition. The CT&E system will not “carry over” this net due company amount to subsequent expense reports.
