Concur Request automates the spend request and approval process for both travel and everyday expenses, giving you the data you need to accurately track and better control spending. By increasing visibility into planned expenses and up-to-date budget data, you can make strategic spending decisions before any spending actually occurs. The Request API provides many possibilities, particularly Requests creation and transition into the approval workflow.

Version 4.0 of Request API works only with the new [Authentication API](/api-reference/authentication/apidoc.html).

The Request v4 API exposes five different resources:

Resource|Description
---|---
Request|You can read, create, update or delete a Request and get the list of existing Requests.
Workflow|You can perform action in the approval workflow of a Request (submit, approve, cancel...)
Expected Expense|You can read, create, update or delete an expected expense, and get the list of expected Expenses for a specific Request.
Request Policy|You can get the list of existing Request policies.
Travel Agency|You can get the description of a Travel Agency office.

These resources are used to manage documents used for pre-spend authorizations within Concur Request.

SAP Concur clients must purchase Concur Request in order to use this API. This API requires the following additional SAP Concur APIs:

* [List](/api-reference/common/list-item/v3.list-item.html), to retrieve the `listId`
* [User profile](/api-reference/profile/v1.user.html), to retrieve the `userId`
* [Expense Report](/api-reference/expense/expense-report/expense-report-get.html), to retrieve the `reportId`

## <a name="access-token-usage"></a>Access Token Usage
