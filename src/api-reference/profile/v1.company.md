The Concur's **company** API is used to help provision and manage companies and their profile details across multiple Concur products, including Expense, Invoice, Request, and Travel.

* [Schema Definition](#scim)
* [Get Company](#get)
* [HTTP Status Codes](#codes)

### Version

1.0

## <a name="scim"></a>Schema Definition

The Company schema is inspired by the work from [System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)](https://tools.ietf.org/wg/scim/), in particular:

* [RFC 7643 System for Cross-domain Identity Management: Core Schema](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7643)
* [RFC 7644 System for Cross-domain Identity Management: Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644) (Optional)

The latest version of the Company schema is always available at: [company.json](./company.json).

## <a name="get"></a>Get Company

Each company in Profile is associated with a unique UUID. And your company access token will limit the company you can query for. You can use the following endpoint to lookup your company:

```
GET /profile/v1/me
(access token required)
```

Curl example:

```
curl -k -v -H "Authorization: Bearer $access-token" "https://$host/profile/v1/me"
```

### Company details

Here is a sample company response.

## <a name="erp-integration"></a>Enterprise Resource Planning Integration

This API provides the partner with 2 key pieces of information:

* Company `UUID` - Partner will record this value per customer connection and use it when submitting Support cases.
* `MarketingName` data element - Partner will record this value per customer. This will indicate the edition type a customer is using:
  * `CTE` or `Enterprise` means the customer is using Professional Edition.
  * `Standard` means the customer is using Standard Edition.
