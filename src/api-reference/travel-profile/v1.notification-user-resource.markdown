SAP Concur continually reviews our products and services for compliance with security best practices. As part of a security improvement to our authentication infrastructure, the decision has been made to retire notifications for Profile, Form of Payment, and Itinerary for a user and company. The decision to remove these notifications rather than refactor them to handle authentication differently was driven by both extremely low usage and a high rate of unsuccessful deliveries.
