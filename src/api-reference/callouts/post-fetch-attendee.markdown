This callout supports the following POST actions:

##  Post Attendee Search Request

### Request URI

The Fetch Attendee version 2.0 callout sends the attendee information to a URI for the application connector, which can be in a custom location for each client. The default is:

`https://{servername}/concur/attendee/v2.0/fetch`

For backward compatibility, Fetch Attendee version 1.0 is used instead of version 2.0 when the URI uses v1.0 instead of v2.0. The URI is configured on the **Application Connector Registration** page under **Web Services>Administration>Manage Applications**.

The application connector responds to the Fetch Attendee request by returning all attendees that match the search criteria. The result is limited to the maximum number of records specified in the request. If more than the maximum number of records are sent, Concur Expense displays a message in the Attendee Search window asking the user to refine their search. The authorization functionality in version 2.0 is the same as version 1.0

## Headers

### Authorization header

Required. Authorization header with Basic authorization for endpoint. Refer to [Authentication][2] for more information.

## Request body

The request body contains an **AttendeeSearchRequest** parent element with an **Attendee** child element. The **Attendee** elements contain the values entered on the search form.

**NOTES**:

* When implementing the search logic, the search criteria should use logical AND between the fields, not logical OR. For example, if in the search dialog the user specifies Doe in the last name field and Acme in the company field, the connector must return only records where the Acme company has contacts with the last name of Doe. It must not return records for contacts with the last name Doe who belong to another company such as Apex.
* If the application connector does not respond or returns an error, the user is notified in a popup window within Expense. Concur will not resend the request unless the user manually initiates the search again.
