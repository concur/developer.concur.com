##  <a name="getlist"></a>GET List of Itineraries

Retrieves trip summaries for the traveler specified in the OAuth token. This endpoint can also be used to get details for trips for a different user or the whole company. This is most often done when a Travel Management Company needs to get a list of trips on behalf of a user or company. During the request, a user with one of the following user roles from the user's company must authenticate through OAuth: Web Services Administrator for Professional, or Can Administer for Standard.

The response for this function can be divided into pages for easier processing.

##  <a name="getdetails"></a>GET Itinerary Details

Retrieves the details for the specified trip. By default, the OAuth consumer should be the owner of the trip. This endpoint can also be used to get details for trips that the OAuth consumer does not own. This is most often done when a Travel Management Company needs to get trip details on behalf of a user. The TMC must be registered with SAP Concur and have a SAP Concur account that has one of the following user roles: Web Services Administrator for Professional, or Can Administer for Standard.  

The returned elements will vary based on the following conditions:

* Some elements, such as **AirlineTickets** or **RailPayments**, will only appear for bookings of the appropriate type.
* Amount values, such as **Rate** or **Tax**, will only appear if the requestor is the source of the booking. All other suppliers will not receive the amount elements associated with the bookings.
* Some elements, such as **SabreDKNumber**, will only appear if the booking was created by the relevant GDS.
* Some elements are vendor-specific and will only appear in responses for the associated vendor.

This documentation contains the full set of possible elements that can be returned. No itinerary can contain all of the possible elements, so the response will always be a subset of the possible returned values.

`{_tripId_}` | **Required.** The identifier for the desired trip.

## <a name="postdetails"></a>POST Itinerary Details

### Description

Creates a new trip or updates an existing trip. A new trip will be created if the trip dates span no existing trip and the request doesn't include a tripId. If a tripId is included in the URI it will update the specified trip. The full trip information is included in the update request, which replaces the existing trip.

This endpoint can be used to create trips for a user that is not the OAuth consumer. This is most often done when a travel supplier or Travel Management Company needs to create a trip on behalf of a user. The supplier or TMC must be registered with SAP Concur and have an SAP Concur account that has one of the following user roles: Web Services Administrator for Professional, or Can Administer for Standard.

###  Agency Proposals

Travel Management Companies for SAP Concur clients with the Agency Proposal feature of Travel Request can send proposed itineraries using the Itinerary web service. The TMC will indicate that the itinerary is a proposal using the **TripStatus** element. The request must also include the **CustomAttributes** element and its child elements.

## <a name="post"></a>POST Booking Details

The supplier or TMC must be registered with SAP Concur, and must have an account that has one of the following user roles: Web Services Administrator for Professional, or Can Administer for Standard.
