### Definitions of Resources

- *__eReceipt__* - A schema-enforced resource with data and, optionally, an image. If an image is not provided, one will be generated from the data resource.
- *__Image-Only Receipt__* - A standalone image without data.

### General

|Endpoint|Response Format|Request Summary|
|---|---|---|
|[GET /](#endpoint-service-index)|JSON|Get service index URLs|
|[GET /v4/status/:receiptId](#endpoint-get-receipt-status)|JSON|Get the status of a receipt|

##### Endpoint: Service Index

###### _GET /_

Making a GET request to the root of the service will return a list of current endpoints. If endpoint URLs ever change, the service index will be updated. To ensure that you are using the correct URLs, the safest practice is to check the service index before every request. The response will include current URLs for all endpoints in the receipt service.

_Example Requests:_

cURL:

```shell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {YOUR ACCESS TOKEN}" https://us.api.concursolutions.com/receipts/
```

HTTPie:

```shell
http https://us.api.concursolutions.com/receipts/ 'Authorization:Bearer {YOUR ACCESS TOKEN}'
```

_Example Response:_

```json
{
  "links": [
    {
      "rel": "self",
      "href": "https://us.api.concursolutions.com/receipts/v4"
    },
    {
      "rel": "receipt-get",
      "method": "GET",
      "href": "https://us.api.concursolutions.com/receipts/v4/{receiptId}"
    },
    {
      "rel": "receipt-post",
      "method": "POST",
      "href": "https://us.api.concursolutions.com/receipts/v4/users/{userId}"
    },

### eReceipts

|Endpoint|Response Format|Request Summary|
|---|---|---|
|[GET /schemas](#endpoint-schemas)|JSON|Get currently supported receipt schemas|
|[POST /v4/users/:userId](#endpoint-post-a-receipt)|N/A|Post a receipt|
|[GET /v4/users/:userId](#endpoint-get-receipts-by-userid)|JSON|Get a user's receipts|
|[GET /v4/:receiptId](#endpoint-get-a-receipt-by-id)|JSON|Get a receipt by ID|
|[GET /v4/:receiptId/image](#endpoint-get-receipt-image)|image file|Get a receipt image.|

##### Endpoint: Schemas

###### _GET /schemas/:schemaId_

|Parameter|Requirement|Value|
|---|---|---|
|schemaId|optional|The ID of the schema to be returned.|

The response to a GET request to `/schemas` will have a list of JSON validation schemas for available receipt types. An array of `supportingSchemas` is also returned, but these do not represent actual receipt types.

If a schema ID is provided, then only the schema with that ID will be returned, instead of the entire schema index. The ID's of schemas are not GUUIDs, but are instead just the names of the schema with the extension `.schema.json`. For example, `car-rental-receipt.schema.json` or `air-receipt.schema.json`.

One of the receipt schemas must be included in the [link header](http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-core.html#anchor35) of receipt POST requests with the relationship of `describedBy`. This looks like `link: <http://schema.concursolutions.com/{RECEIPT TYPE}.schema.json>;rel=describedBy`.

_Example Requests:_

cURL for the schema index:

```shell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {YOUR ACCESS TOKEN}" https://us.api.concursolutions.com/receipts/schemas/
```

HTTPie for the schema index:

```shell
http https://us.api.concursolutions.com/receipts/schemas 'Authorization:Bearer {YOUR ACCESS TOKEN}'
```

cURL for a single schema:

```shell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {YOUR ACCESS TOKEN}" https://us.api.concursolutions.com/receipts/schemas/car-rental-receipt.schema.json
```

HTTPie for a single schema:

```shell

```

##### Endpoint: Get Receipt Status

###### GET /v4/status/:receiptId

|Parameter|Requirement|Value|
|---|---|---|
|receiptId|required|The UUID of the receipt associated with the image.|

This endpoint may be used to see the current processing status of a receipt.

When a successful POST request is made is made the ```Link``` header of the response contains a 'processing-status' URL. This processing-status URL will be available for two weeks after the initial POST and will provide information regarding the processing status of your receipt.

There are four possible top level statuses: `ACCEPTED`, `FAILED`, `PROCESSING`, and `PROCESSED`.

In additional to a high level status, information will be provided in an array of event logs. Events that may be included in the logs will be typed as `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `WARNING`, or `ERROR`.

Example event messages:

|Type|Message|
|---|---|
|INFO| Receipt accepted. Queued for processing. |
|INFO| Initiated receipt processing. (event for each attempt) |
|ERROR| Error from User Profile service. Queued for reprocessing. |
|ERROR| Error from Imaging service. Queued for reprocessing. |
|ERROR| Error during image generation or retrieval. Queued for reprocessing. |
|INFO| Receipt image generated. |
|ERROR| Processing failed. |
|INFO| Processing finished. |

_Example Requests:_

cURL:

```shell
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {YOUR ACCESS TOKEN}" https://us.api.concursolutions.com/receipts/v4/status/{RECEIPT ID}
```

HTTPie:

```shell
http https://us.api.concursolutions.com/receipts/v4/status/{RECEIPT ID} "Authorization: Bearer {YOUR ACCESS TOKEN}"
```

_Example Response:_

```json
{
  "status": "PROCESSED",
  "logs": [
    {
      "logLevel": "INFO",
      "message": "Receipt accepted. Queued for processing.",
      "timestamp": "Mon, 08 May 2017 23:05:52 GMT"
    },
    {
      "logLevel": "INFO",
      "message": "Initiated receipt processing.",
      "timestamp": "Mon, 08 May 2017 23:05:52 GMT"
    },
    {
      "logLevel": "INFO",
      "message": "Receipt image generated.",
      "timestamp": "Mon, 08 May 2017 23:05:53 GMT"

##### Endpoint: Post a Receipt

###### _POST /v4/users/:userId_

|Parameter|Requirement|Value|
|---|---|---|
|userId|required|The UUID of the user to whom the receipt belongs.|
|receipt|required|The JSON receipt to be posted.|
|image|optional|Image of the receipt. If an image isn't provided, one will be generated automatically from the JSON.|

Creating a receipt requires JSON data about the transaction and, optionally, an image of the receipt. If an image is not supplied with the request, Concur will automatically generate a receipt image based on the data provided. [JSON schemas](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/receipts/get-started.html#endpoint-schemas) are used to validate the format of receipt data received in POST requests.

Successful POST requests will receive a response of 201 Created. The `Location` header of the response contains a URL for your receipt. Once the receipt has been processed, it can be retrieved at this URL. The `Link` header of the response contains a processing-status URL for your receipt. More information can be found [here](#endpoint-get-receipt-status).

If you are not providing an image with your receipt data, the body of the request should be your receipt JSON:

Receipt images may be posted along with data. In this case, Concur will use the provided image instead of generating a new one. To post data and an image, use multipart form data. The `Content-Type:multipart/form-data` header must be set. The image should be included under the key `image`, and the receipt JSON should be included under the key `receipt`. Image files are limited to a maximum size of 5MB. Accepted file formats for image files are: image/png, image/jpg, image/jpeg, image/tiff, image/tif, image/gif, and application/pdf.

_Example Requests:_

cURL data without image:

```shell
curl -v -X POST https://us.api.concursolutions.com/receipts/v4/users/{USER ID FROM YOUR ID TOKEN} \
-H "Authorization: Bearer {YOUR ACCESS TOKEN}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "link: <http://schema.concursolutions.com/{VALIDATION SCHEMA FROM SCHEMA ENDPOINT}.schema.json>;rel=describedBy" \
-d @{PATH TO YOUR RECEIPT JSON}
```

cURL data and image:

```shell
curl -v -k -X POST https://us.api.concursolutions.com/receipts/v4/users/{USER ID FROM YOUR ID TOKEN} \
-H "Authorization: Bearer {YOUR ACCESS TOKEN}" \
-H "Content-Type:multipart/form-data" \
-H "link: <http://schema.concursolutions.com/{VALIDATION SCHEMA FROM SCHEMA ENDPOINT}.schema.json>;rel=describedBy" \
-F "receipt=<{PATH TO YOUR RECEIPT JSON};type=application/json" \
-F "image=@{PATH TO YOUR IMAGE};type={FILE MIME TYPE OF YOUR IMAGE}"
```

HTTPie data without image:

```shell
http POST https://us.api.concursolutions.com/receipts/v4/users/{USER ID FROM YOUR ID TOKEN} \
"Authorization:Bearer {YOUR ACCESS TOKEN}" \
"Content-Type: application/json" \
"link: <http://schema.concursolutions.com/{VALIDATION SCHEMA FROM SCHEMA ENDPOINT}.schema.json>;rel=describedBy" \
