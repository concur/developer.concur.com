The Receipts resource represents receipts that can be posted to Concur by a provider company on behalf of opted-in users. This resource currently supports three types of receipts:

* General — A general-purpose receipt type that can be used for various goods or services
* Hotel — A receipt for a hospitality service, such as a hotel stay
* Ride — A receipt for a ride service

**Notes:**

* Receipts currently can't be Posted to users whose data is hosted in Concur's EU datacenter. Only users whose data is hosted in the US datacenter can receive e-receipts.
* The Receipt Service only accepts receipts that are up to 6 months old. Older receipts will not be accepted.
* Unlike all the other Concur API endpoints, the e-receipt requires the Concur Platform team to configure your sandbox to enable access.
