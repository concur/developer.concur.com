## <a name="ac-jwt"></a>Access Control (JWT)

The Event Subscription Service (ESS) API uses the standard SAP Concur OAuth2 Framework for Authentication and Authorization via a JSON Web Token (JWT).

The authentication is done by using a JWT which represents the event subscriber. This can be obtained by calling the [Client Credentials](/api-reference/authentication/apidoc.html#client_credentials) grant type using your OAuth2 credentials. The JWT generated by this grant will have a `JWT Type` of `App` where your `Application ID` is the `Subject` of the Token.

For authorization, the Application needs to contain the scope `events.topic.read` in order to access the ESS API. This scope will be inherited by the JWT during the Client Credentials Grant which is then checked by the ESS API.

Pass the JWT in the Post Header when making calls to the ESS API:

```
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
```
The Client Credentials JWT has a lifetime of 60 minutes and can only be obtained again via the Client Credentials Grant.

## <a name="get-topics"></a>Browse Available Topics

Before you create any subscriptions you need to verify that you have sufficient access to the topic. If that request returns an empty response you need to get in touch with your SAP Concur contact to set proper scopes to your OAuth2 application.

**Request**
```
GET /events/v4/topics
```
**Response**
```json
["public.test"]
```

## <a name="put-subscription"></a>Create a Subscription

To create a subscription you need to:

* Know and have the sufficient access to the topic by having the correct scopes.
* Get your receiving endpoint running, see the [endpoint requirements](/api-reference/common/ess/getting-started.html#endpoint-requirements).   
* Come up with unique name (id) of your subscription. Subscription names are globally unique, and you will get an error if the name is already in use.
* Set filter to `.*` (regexp syntax), you can use it later to filter out unwanted types of events.

**Request**
```
PUT /events/v4/subscriptions/webhook
```
```json
{
  "id": "my-unique-subscription-id",
  "filter": ".*",
  "topic": "public.test",
  "webHookConfig": {
    "endpoint": "https://www.concuress.com/sub/my-valid-endpoint"
  }
}
```

**Request Parameters**

Name | Type | Format | Description
------- |----- |----|-----
`Id` |`String` |Lowercase letters, numbers, "." and  "-"| Your unique subscription name. It is suggested that you use something self explanatory. For example: `my-company.my-scenario.env.version`
`Filter` |`String` | regular expression  | Allows you to reduce the number of delivered events to a certain type. Example, setting to `eventCreated` will only get this event type delivered, other event types will be skipped. Set to ".*" to receive ALL events in the topic.
`Topic` |`String` | -  | Topic, stream of events you are subscribing to.
`Endpoint` |`String` | URL  | Your endpoint where events will be delivered.                |

**Response**
```json
{"message":"Subscription 'my-unique-subscription-id' saved successfully"}
```

## <a name="get-subscription"></a>Verify Your Subscription

You can always request a configuration of your subscription. You might notice that your subscription contains some parameters that you can not modify for security reasons, but you can use them for troubleshooting purposes.
* `applicationId` - identifies your application as an owner of that subscription.
* `companyIds` - a list of UUIDs of companies that allowed your application to access their data, the process of connecting a company to your application is described [here](/manage-apps/go-market-docs/guide-to-enabling-app-center-solutions-basic.html).
* groups and scope - are used for complex access control scenarios.  

**Request**
```
GET /events/v4/subscriptions/my-unique-subscription-id
```
**Response**
```json
[
    {
        "id": "my-unique-subscription-id",

## <a name="get-subscription-list"></a>Browse Existing Subscriptions

If you happen to forget your subscription name/id, you can always retrieve all of your subscriptions by calling the following endpoint:  

**Request**
```
GET /events/v4/subscriptions
```
**Response**
```json
[
    {
        "id": "my-second-unique-subscription-id",
        "topic": "public.test",
        "filter": ".*",
        "webHookConfig": {
