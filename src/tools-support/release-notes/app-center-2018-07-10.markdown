Green Tomato Cars launched in 2006 as London’s first ethical and eco-friendly passenger car company and now offer ground transport solutions nationwide. Environmental responsibility was at the heart of the business when it was established and that ethos remains central to the company today. Our mission statement – ‘’Ethical transport to meet the needs of our customers that does not cost the earth” - strongly connects the company with its roots.

We were the first London private hire company to:
  * use hybrid vehicles
  * use fuel-cell vehicles
  * double offset emissions
  * deploy real-time air quality sensors in our vehicles

Open a Corporate account with us and consolidate all your ground transportation requirements through one booking platform, whilst seamlessly expensing using e-Receipts, so you have full visibility of spend and usage.

How do we make our client experience better?
  * Ultralow-emission fleet (Standard, Executive and 6-8 seaters)
  * Fastest growing zero-emission fleet in London
  * All unavoidable emissions offset by 200% through carbon projects = carbon positive solution
  * Drivers vetted and trained by us
  * Company-owned, maintained and serviced vehicles to make sure they are in immaculate condition - inside and out
