![DUFL](./sap-concur-app-center-release-notes-2016-dufl.jpg)

Imagine having a personal valet to simplify your business travel by shipping, cleaning and storing your business attire. DUFL does that, and automates the expensing too!

A premium travel service, DUFL stores your clothing in your personal DUFL closet, and allows you to virtually ‘pack’ by selecting your clothing items from within our app. Once you’ve scheduled your trip, we’ll send your freshly cleaned and neatly packed clothing to your hotel so you can travel bag-free. When you’re ready to head home, log in to the app to schedule a pickup and we’ll ship your clothes to the warehouse where we will clean, inventory and place them in your DUFL virtual closet until you are ready for your next trip.

Getting started is easy:

* Download the DUFL app on your iOS or Android device and register to receive your welcome kit, instructions and shipping labels.
* Connect DUFL to your Concur Expense account for automated expensing.
* Pack your DUFL suitcase with everything you will need on the road – full-sized toiletries, work-out clothes, business attire, and casual outfits – and schedule a pickup within the app. We’ll pick up your bag, take inventory, clean and photograph your clothes, and upload them into your virtual closet.
* When you are ready to travel, schedule your trip and pack within the app, set your arrival date and destination, and your bag will meet you there.
* Use the DUFL app to set cleaning preferences, manage inventory, schedule trips and track your DUFL.
* When your trip ends, schedule a pickup in the app. We’ll grab your DUFL from your hotel and ship it back to the DUFL warehouse for processing.
* Then export your e-receipt via the DUFL app to your Concur account for easy expensing. It’s that simple!

Take the hassle out of packing, carrying on or checking in – download the DUFL app and we’ll have your bag ready for your next trip!

DUFL works with Expense for Concur Standard and Expense for Concur Professional. It will be available soon in the Concur App Center under Apps for Me at www.Concur.com/AppCenter. For more information about DUFL, visit their website at http://www.dufl.com/.
