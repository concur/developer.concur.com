## <a name="v4purchaserequest"></a>New Purchase Request v4 API

A new [Purchase Request v4](/api-reference/invoice/v4.purchase-request-get-started.html) API is available from the SAP Concur Developer Center.

### Business Purpose / Client Benefit

The Purchase Request API gives SAP Concur clients the ability to leverage external data to create purchase requests for pre-authorization of purchase orders. Clients can build a direct connection to the Purchase Request API which will create new purchase requests and automatically submit them into the pre-authorization workflow. Once approved, the purchase request results in a purchase order that can be transmitted to a vendor from SAP Concur.
