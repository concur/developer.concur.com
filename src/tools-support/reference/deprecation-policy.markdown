# API Lifecycle & Deprecation Policy
The Concur API Lifecycle & Deprecation Policy is part of our [API terms and conditions of use.](/Terms-of-Use.html) We may make periodic updates to this Policy, at which time we will notify those who have agreements with us.

## API Version Status  

* **Active:** An active API version is the most current and fully supported API. It is the recommended version to use by everyone.
* **Deprecated:** A deprecated API version has been superseded by a newer API version. It is supported (bug fixes) for six months from the deprecation date. New apps will be denied access to deprecated APIs.
* **Retired:** A retired API version is no longer supported. It includes any API deprecated for more than six months. Any application using a retired API must migrate to an active API.
* **Decommissioned:** A decommissioned API version is no longer available on production. This occurs after three (3) months of inactivity in Retired state.
